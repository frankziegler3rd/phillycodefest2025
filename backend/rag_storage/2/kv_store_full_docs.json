Modern education includes morality;\ntherefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder\ntales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard\nof Oz\" was written solely to please children of today. It aspires to\nbeing a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are\nretained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\nL. Frank Baum\nChicago, April, 1900."

There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which\nmade one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove,\na cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the\nbeds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and\nDorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all,\nand no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground, called a\ncyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great\nwhirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It\nwas reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a\nladder led down into the small, dark hole.\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could\nsee nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the\nedge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land\ninto a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass\nwas not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades\nuntil they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.

They had taken the sparkle\nfrom her eyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red\nfrom her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and\ngaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan,\nfirst came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's\nlaughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart\nwhenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; and she still\nlooked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to\nlaugh at.\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till\nnight and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his\nlong beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and\nrarely spoke.\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing\nas gray as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little\nblack dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled\nmerrily on either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day\nlong, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\nToday, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the\ndoorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer\nthan usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and\nlooked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle\nHenry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves\nbefore the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the\nair from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw\nripples in the grass coming from that direction also.\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife. \"I'll go look\nafter the stock.\" Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and"

Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the\ntrap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small,\ndark hole. Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her\naunt. When she was halfway across the room there came a great\nshriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her\nfooting and sat down suddenly upon the floor.\nThen a strange thing happened.\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly\nthrough the air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made\nit the exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air\nis generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of\nthe house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top\nof the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and\nmiles away as easily as you could carry a feather.\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but\nDorothy found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls\naround, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as\nif she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\nToto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,\nbarking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to\nsee what would happen.\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first\nthe little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his\nears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air\nwas keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,\ncaught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again,"

The hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was\nwhite, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her\nshoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun\nlike diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as\ntheir hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at\nthe tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle\nHenry, for two of them had beards. But the little woman was\ndoubtless much older. Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair\nwas nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was\nstanding in the doorway, they paused and whispered among\nthemselves, as if afraid to come farther. But the little old woman\nwalked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the\nMunchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked\nWitch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent,\nharmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles\nfrom home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy\nsaid, with hesitation, \"You are very kind, but there must be some\nmistake. I have not killed anything.\"\n\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a\nlaugh, \"and that is the same thing. See!\" she continued, pointing to"

It was gingham, with\nchecks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat\nfaded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock.

There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the\nfarther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country\nbecame.\nAt noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and\nDorothy opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a\npiece to the Scarecrow, but he refused.\n\"I am never hungry,\" he said, \"and it is a lucky thing I am not, for\nmy mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could\neat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would\nspoil the shape of my head.\""

Then I made up my mind that\ninstead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become\nlonely.\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I\nsoon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised\nto marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better\nhouse for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived\nwith an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she\nwas so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the\ncooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked\nWitch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she\nwould prevent the marriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted\nmy axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I\nwas anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible,\nthe axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged\nman could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a\ntinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked\nvery well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked\nWitch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not\nmarry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my\naxe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith,\nand again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe\ncut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had\nthem replaced with tin ones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe\nslip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of\nme.

They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he\ndid it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion\nsprang across the ditch again.\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms\nand climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one\nhand. The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the\nair; and then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on\nthe other side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin\nWoodman, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the\nbeast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath\nshort, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark\nand gloomy.

To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in\nthe depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was\nin this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.\n\"What are the Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.\n\"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\ntigers,\" replied the Lion, \"and with claws so long and sharp that they\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto.

If the Tin\nWoodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we\ncan walk across it easily.\"\n\"That is a first-rate idea,\" said the Lion. \"One would almost\nsuspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw.\"\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that\nthe tree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his\nstrong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and\nslowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with\nits top branches on the other side.\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp\ngrowl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running\ntoward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\ntigers.\n\"They are the Kalidahs!\" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to\ntremble.\n\"Quick!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Let us cross over.\"\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next.

Her hair was a\nrich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her\ndress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly\nupon the little girl.\n\"What can I do for you, my child?\" she asked.\nDorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought\nher to the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of\nthe wonderful adventures they had met with.\n\"My greatest wish now,\" she added, \"is to get back to Kansas, for\nAunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me,\nand that will make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are"

The only thing that worries me\nis how to cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.\"\n\"By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged\nMonkeys to carry you to the gates of the Emerald City,\" said Glinda,\n\"for it would be a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a\nruler.\"\n\"Am I really wonderful?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"You are unusual,\" replied Glinda.\nTurning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, \"What will become of\nyou when Dorothy leaves this country?\"\nHe leaned on his axe and thought a moment.

If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very\nhappily there.\"\n\"My third command to the Winged Monkeys,\" said Glinda, \"shall\nbe to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of\nthe Golden Cap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he\nand his band may thereafter be free for evermore.\"\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked\nthe Good Witch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:\n\"You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not\nyet told me how to get back to Kansas.\"\n\"Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,\" replied Glinda.\n\"If you had known their power you could have gone back to your\nAunt Em the very first day you came to this country.\"\n\"But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!\" cried the\nScarecrow. \"I might have passed my whole life in the farmer's\ncornfield.\"\n\"And I should not have had my lovely heart,\" said the Tin\nWoodman. \"I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end\nof the world.\"\n\"And I should have lived a coward forever,\" declared the Lion,\n\"and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to\nme.\""

Then she kissed the Tin Woodman,\nwho was weeping in a way most dangerous to his joints. But she\nhugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrow in her arms instead\nof kissing his painted face, and found she was crying herself at this\nsorrowful parting from her loving comrades.\nGlinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the\nlittle girl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the\nkindness she had shown to her friends and herself.\nDorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said\none last good-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three\ntimes, saying:\n\"Take me home to Aunt Em!\"\nInstantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she\ncould see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.\nThe Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so\nsuddenly that she rolled over upon the grass several times before\nshe knew where she was.\nAt length, however, she sat up and looked about her."
