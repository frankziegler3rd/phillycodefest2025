SCOTT FITZGERALD\nThen wear the gold hat, if that will move her;\nIf you can bounce high, bounce for her too,\nTill she cry “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,\nI must have you!”\n—Tuomas Parke D’Invitusras.\nNEW YORK\nCHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS\n1925\n\nCopyricnt, 1925, sy\nCHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS\nPrinted in the United States of America\n\nONCE AGAIN\nTO\nZELDA\nHcoe,a\naly\nS4 er\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY\nCHAPTER I\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father\ngave me some advice that I’ve been turning over\nin my mind ever since.\n“Whenever you feel like criticising any one,” he\ntold me, ‘‘just remember that all the people in this\nworld haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”\nHe didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been\nunusually communicative in a reserved way, and I\nunderstood that he meant a great deal more than\nthat. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all\njudgments, a habit that has opened up many curi-\nous natures to me and also made me the victim of\nnot a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is\nquick to detect and attach itself to this quality\nwhen it appears in a normal person, and so it came\nabout that in college I was unjustly accused of\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret\ngriefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences\nwere unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,\npreoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation\nwas quivering on the horizon; for the intimate\nrevelations of young men, or at least the terms in\nI\n\n2 THE GREAT GATSBY\nwhich they express them, are usually plagiaristic\nand marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a\nlittle afraid of missing something if I forget that, as\nmy father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is par-\ncelled out unequally at birth.\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I\ncome to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct\nmay be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,\nbut after a certain point I don’t care what it’s\nfounded on. When I came back from the East last\nautumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in\nuniform and at a sort of moral attention forever;\nI wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged\nglimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the\nman who gives his name to this book, was exempt\nfrom my reaction—Gatsby, who represented every-\nthing for which I have an unaffected scorn. If per-\nsonality is an unbroken series of successful gestures,\nthen there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if\nhe were related to one of those intricate machines\nthat register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.\nThis responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the\nname of the ‘creative temperament”—it was an\nextraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness\nsuch as I have never found in any other person and\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 3\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—\nGatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what\npreyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\ninterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded\nelations of men.\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do peo-\nple in this Middle Western city for three generations.\nThe Carraways are something of a clan, and we have\na tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes\nof Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was\nmy grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-\none, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started\nthe wholesale hardware business that my father car-\nries on to-day.\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to\nlook like him—with special reference to the rather\nhard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office.\nI graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quar-\nter of a century after my father, and al ittle later I\nparticipated in that delayed Teutonic migration\nknown as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-\nraid so thoroughly that I came back restless. In-\nstead of being the warm centre of the world, the\nMiddle West now seemed like the ragged edge of\nthe universe—so I decided to go East and learn the\nbond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond\nbusiness, so I supposed it could support one more\n\n4 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsingle man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over\nas if they were choosing a prep school for me, and\nfinally said, ‘‘Why—ye-es,”’ with very grave, hesi-\ntant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year,\nand after various delays I came East, permanently,\nI thought, in the spring of twenty-two.\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city,\nbut it was a warm season, and I had just left a\ncountry of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when\na young man at the office suggested that we take a\nhouse together in a commuting town, it sounded\nlike a great idea. He found the house, a weather-\nbeaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Wash-\nington, and I went out to the country alone. I had\na dog—at least I had him for a few days until he\nran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman,\nwho made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut-\ntered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric\nstove.\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning\nsome man, more recently arrived than I, stopped\nme on the road.\n“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked\nhelplessly.\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no\nlonger. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original set-\ntler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom\nof the neighborhood.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 5\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of\nleaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in\nfast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life\nwas beginning over again with the summer.\nThere was so much to read, for one thing, and so\nmuch fine health to be pulled down out of the young\nbreath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on\nbanking and credit and investment securities, and\nthey stood on my shelf in red and gold like new\nmoney from the mint, promising to unfold the shin-\ning secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Me-\ncenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading\nmany other books besides. I was rather literary in\ncollege—one year I wrote a series of very solemn\nand obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now\nI was going to bring back all such things into my\nlife and become again that most limited of all\nspecialists, the ‘well-rounded man.” This isn’t just\nan epigram—life is much more successfully looked\nat from a single window, after all.\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have\nrented a house in one of the strangest communities\nin North America. It was on that slender riotous\nisland which extends itself due east of New York\n—and where there are, among other natural curi-\nosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty\nmiles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identi-\ncal in contour and separated only by a courtesy\nbay, jut out into the most domesticated body of\n\n6 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsalt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet\nbarnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not per-\nfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they\nare both crushed flat at the contact end—but their\nphysical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nwonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wing-\nless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimi-\nlarity in every particular except shape and size.\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashion-\nable of the two, though this is a most superficial\ntag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister\ncontrast between them. My house was at the very\ntip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and\nsqueezed between two huge places that rented for\ntwelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my\nright was a colossal affair by any standard—it was\na factual imitation of some Hétel de Ville in Nor-\nmandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new\nunder a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swim-\nming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and\ngarden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I\ndidn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited\nby a gentleman of that name. My own house was\nan eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had\nbeen overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a\npartial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the con-\nsoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dol-\nlars a month.\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 7\nfashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and\nthe history of the summer really begins on the eve-\nning I drove over there to have dinner with the\nTom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once\nremoved, and I’d known Tom in college. And just af-\nter the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\nHer husband, among various physical accomplish-\nments, had been one of the most powerful ends that\never played football at New Haven—a national fig-\nure in a way, one of those men who reach such an\nacute limited excellence at twenty-one that every-\nthing afterward savors of anti-climax. His family\nwere enormously wealthy—even in college his free-\ndom with money was a matter for reproach—but\nnow he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion\nthat rather took your breath away: for instance,\nhe’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\nForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my\nown generation was wealthy enough to do that.\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had\nspent a year in France for no particular reason, and\nthen drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This\nwas a permanent move, said Daisy over the tele-\nphone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into\nDaisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on\nforever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic\nturbulence of some irrecoverable football game.\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy eve-\n\n8 THE GREAT GATSBY\nning I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends\nwhom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even\nmore elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-\nwhite Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the\nbay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward\nthe front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—\nfinally when it reached the house drifting up the\nside in bright vines as though from the momentum\nof its run. The front was broken bya line of French\nwindows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide\nopen to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Bu-\nchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs\napart on the front porch.\nHe had changed since his New Haven years.\nNow he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty\nwith a rather hard mouth and a supercilious man-\nner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\ndominance over his face and gave him the appear-\nance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could\nhide the enormous power of that body—he seemed\nto fill those glistening boots until he strained the\ntop lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin\ncoat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage\n—a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to\nthe impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 9\nwas a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward\npeople he liked—and there were men at New Haven\nwho had hated his guts.\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters\nis final,” he seemed to say, “just because ’m\nstronger and more of a man than you are.” We\nwere in the same senior society, and while we were\nnever intimate I always had the impression that he\napproved of me and wanted me to like him with\nsome harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n“T’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes\nflashing about restlessly.\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a\nbroad flat hand along the front vista, including in\nits sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of\ndeep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat\nthat bumped the tide offshore.\n“Tt belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned\nme around again, politely and abruptly. “‘We’ll go\ninside.”\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright\nrosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by\nFrench windows at either end. The windows were\najar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the\nhouse. A breeze blew through the room, blew cur-\ntains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,\ntwisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake\n\n10 THE GREAT GATSBY\nof the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-\ncolored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does\non the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the\nroom was an enormous couch on which two young\nwomen were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white, and their dresses\nwere rippling and fluttering as if they had just been\nblown back in after a short flight around the house.\nI must have stood for a few moments listening to\nthe whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of\na picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as\nTom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the\ncaught wind died out about the room, and the cur-\ntains and the rugs and the two young women bal-\nlooned slowly to the floor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me.\nShe was extended full length at her end of the\ndivan, completely motionless, and with her chin\nraised al ittle, as if she were balancing something on\nit which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out\nof the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—\nindeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an\napology for having disturbed her by coming in.\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—\nshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious ex-\npression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming\nlittle laugh, and I laughed too and came forward\ninto the room.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY II\n“Tm p-paralyzed with happiness.”\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very\nwitty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up\ninto my face, promising that there was no one in\nthe world she so much wanted to see. That was a\nway she had. She hinted in a murmur that the sur-\nname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard\nit said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made\nit no less charming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nod-\nded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly\ntipped her head back again—the object she was bal-\nancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\nsomething of a fright. Again a sort of apology\narose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete\nself-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me\nquestions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the\nkind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as\nif each speech is an arrangement of notes that will\nnever be played again. Her face was sad and lovely\nwith bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright\npassionate mouth, but there was an excitement in\nher voice that men who had cared for her found\ndifficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered\n“Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, excit-\ning things just a while since and that there were\ngay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\n12 THE GREAT GATSBY\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a\nday on my way East, and how a dozen people had\nsent their love through me.\n“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.\n“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have\nthe left rear wheel painted black as a mourning\nwreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along\nthe north shore.”\n“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. To-mor-\nrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to\nsee the baby.”\n“T’d like to.”\n“‘She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t\nyou ever seen her?”\n“Never.”\n“Well, you ought to see her. She’s——”’\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly\nabout the room, stopped and rested his hand on my\nshoulder.\n“What you doing, Nick?”\n“T’m a bond man.”\n‘Who with?”\nI told him.\n“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.\nThis annoyed me.\n“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you\nstay in the East.”\n“Oh, T’ll stay in tne East, don’t you worry,” he\nsaid, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 13\nhe were alert for something more. “I’d be a God\ndamned fool to live anywhere else.”\nAt this point Miss Baker said: ‘‘ Absolutely !” with\nsuch suddenness that I started—it was the first\nword she had uttered since I came into the room.\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for\nshe yawned and with a series of rapid, deft move-\nments stood up into the room.\n“T’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on\nthat sofa for as long as I can remember.”\n“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been\ntrying to get you to New York all afternoon.”\n\" “No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cock-\ntails just in from the pantry, “I’m absolutely in\ntraining.”\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\n“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were\na drop in the bottom of a glass. ‘How you ever get\nanything done is beyond me.”\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was\nshe “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was\na slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect car-\nriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body\nbackward at the shoulders like a young cadet.\nHer gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with\npolite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charm-\ning, discontented face. It occurred to me now that\nI had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere\nbefore.\n\n14 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemp-\ntuously. “I know somebody there.”\n“T don’t know a single——”’\n“You must know Gatsby.”\n“Gatsb?y” ” demanded Daisy. “‘What Gatsby?”\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbor\ndinner was announced; wedging his tense arm im-\nperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\nme from the room as though he were moving a\nchecker to another square.\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on\ntheir hips, the two young women preceded us out\nonto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset,\nwhere four candles flickered on the table in the\ndiminished wind.\n“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She\nsnapped them out with her fingers. ‘In two weeks\nit’ll be the longest day in the year.”” She looked at\nus all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the\nlongest day of the year and then miss it? I al-\nways watch for the longest day in the year and then\nmiss it.”\n“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss\nBaker, sitting down at the table as if she were get-\nting into bed.\n“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She\nturned to me helplessly: ‘‘What do people plan?”’\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an\nawed expression on her little finger.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 15\n“Look !”” she complained; “IT hurt it.”\nWe all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\n“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know\nyou didn’t mean to, but you did do it. That’s what\nI get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big,\nhulking physical specimen of a -\n“TY hate that word hulking,” objected Tom crossly,\n“even in kidding.”\n“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once,\nunobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence\nthat was never quite chatter, that was as cool as\ntheir white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the\nabsence of all desire. They were here, and they ac-\ncepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant\neffort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\nthat presently dinner would be over anda little\nlater the evening too would be over and casually\nput away. It was sharply different from the West,\nwhere an evening was hurried from phase to phase\ntoward its close, in a continually disappointed an-\nticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the\nmoment itself.\n“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I con-\nfessed on my second glass of corky but rather im-\npressive claret. ‘“‘Can’t you talk about crops or\nsomethin?g”\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but\nit was taken up in an unexpected way.\n\n16 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“‘Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom\nviolently. “I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist\nabout things. Have you read ‘The Rise of the Col-\nored Empires’ by this man Goddard?”\n“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his\ntone.\n“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to\nread it. The idea is if we don’t look out the white\nrace will be—will be utterly submerged. It’s all sci-\nentific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with\nan expression of unthoughtful sadness. “He reads\ndeep books with long words in them. What was\nthat word we——”’\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted\nTom, glancing at her impatiently. ‘This fellow has\nworked out the whole thing. It’s up to us, who are\nthe dominant race, to watch out or these other\nraces will have control of things.”\n““We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy,\nwinking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss\nBaker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily\nin his chair.\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you\nare, and you are, and—’’ After an infinitesimal hesi-\ntation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she\nwinked at me again. ‘‘“—And we’ve produced all the\nthings that go to make civilization—oh, science and\nart, and all that. Do you see?”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 17\nThere was something pathetic in his concentra-\ntion, as if his complacency, more acute than of old,\nwas not enough to him any more. When, almost\nimmediately, the telephone rang inside and the but-\nler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momen-\ntary interruption and leaned toward me.\n“Tl tell you a family secret,” she whispered en-\nthusiastically. “It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you\nwant to hear about the butler’s nose?”\n“‘That’s why I came over to-night.”\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be\nthe silver polisher for some people in New York\nthat had a silver service for two hundred people.\nHe had to polish it from morning till night, until\nfinally it began to affect his nose——”\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss\nBaker.\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until\nfinally he had to give up his position.”\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic\naffection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled\nme forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow\nfaded, each light deserting her with lingering regret,\nlike children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\nThe butler came back and murmured something\nclose to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed\nback his chair, and without a word went inside.\nAs if his absence quickened something within her,\nDaisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and\nsinging.\n\n18 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind\nme of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?”’\nShe turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: “An\nabsolute rose?”\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a\nrose. She was only extemporizing, but a stirring\nwarmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying\nto come out to you concealed in one of those breath-\nless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her\nnapkin on the table and excused herself and went\ninto the house.\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance con-\nsciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak\nwhen she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warn-\ning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was\naudible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned\nforward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur\ntrembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,\nmounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor—”\nI began.\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n“Ts something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss\nBaker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody\nknew.”\n“T don’t.”\n““Why—” she said hesitantly, ‘“Tom’s got some\nwoman in New York.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 19\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\nMiss Baker nodded.\n“She might have the decency not to telephone\nhim at dinner time. Don’t you think?”\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there\nwas the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather\nboots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the\ntable.\n“Tt couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense\ngayety.\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker\nand then at me, and continued: “TI looked outdoors\nfor a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors.\nThere’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a\nnightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star\nLine. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s\nromantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to\nme: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to\ntake you down to the stables.”\nThe telephone rang inside, startingly, and as\nDaisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject\nof the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air.\nAmong the broken fragments of the last five minutes\nat table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look\nsquarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. I\ncouldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking,\nbut I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have\n\n20 THE GREAT GATSBY\nmastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able ut-\nterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic ur-\ngency out of mind. To a certain temperament the\nsituation might have seemed intriguing—my own\ninstinct was to telephone immediately for the\npolice.\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned\nagain. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of\ntwilight between them, strolled back into the library,\nas if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\ntrying to look pleasantly interested anda little deaf,\nI followed Daisy around a chain of connecting ver-\nandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we\nsat down side by side on a wicker settee.\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its\nlovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out\ninto the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions\npossessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\nsome sedative questions about her little girl.\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,”’ she\nsaid suddenly. ‘‘Even if we are cousins. You didn’t\ncome to my wedding.”\n“‘T wasn’t back from the war.”\n““That’s true.” She hesitated. ‘‘Well, I’ve had a\nvery bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about\neverything.”\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she\ndidn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned\nrather feebly to the subject of her daughter.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 21\n“T suppose she talks, and—eats, and every-\nthing.”\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. ‘Listen,\nNick; let me tell you what I said when she was\nborn. Would you like to hear?”\n“Very much.”\n“Tt’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—\nthings. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom\nwas God knows where. I woke up out of the ether\nwith an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the\nnurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told\nme it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and\nwept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And\nI hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl\ncan be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,”\nshe went on in a convinced way. ‘‘ Everybody thinks\nso—the most advanced people. And I know. Ive\nbeen everywhere and seen everything and done\neverything.” Her eyes flashed around her in a de-\nfiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with\nthrilling scorn. ‘‘Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisti-\ncated !”\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel\nmy attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity\nof what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though\nthe whole evening had been a trick of some sort to\nexact a contributary emotion from me. I waited,\nand sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with\n\n22 THE GREAT GATSBY\nan absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had\nasserted her membership in a rather distinguished\nsecret society to which she and Tom belonged.\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light.\nTom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long\ncouch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday\nEvening Post—the words, murmurous and unin-\nflected, running together in a soothing tune. The\nlamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the\nautumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the\npaper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender\nmuscles in her arms.\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment\nwith a lifted hand.\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine\non the table, “in our very next issue.”\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement\nof her knee, and she stood up.\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding\nthe time on the ceiling. ‘Time for this good girl to\ngo to bed.”\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament to-\nmorrow,” explained Daisy, ‘‘over at Westchester.”\n“Qh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleas-\ning contemptuous expression had looked out at me\nfrom many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life\nat Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 23\nhad heard some story of her too, a critical, un-\npleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long\nago.\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at\neight, won’t you.”\n“Tf you'll get up.”\n“T will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you\nanon.”\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. ‘‘In fact\nI think [ll arrange a marriage. Come over often,\nNick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together. You\nknow—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and\npush you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of\nthing——”\n“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs.\n“T haven’t heard a word.”\n“‘She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment.\n“They oughtn’t to let her run around the country\nthis way.”\n““Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.\n“Her family.”\n“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years\nold. Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t\nyou, Nick? She’s going to spend lots of week-ends\nout here this summer. I think the home influence\nwill be very good for her.”\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a mo-\nment in silence.\n“Ts she from New York?” I asked quickly.\n\n24 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed\ntogether there. Our beautiful white——”\n“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk\non the veranda?” demanded Tom suddenly.\n“Did I?” She looked at me. “‘I can’t seem to\nremember, but I think we talked about the Nordic\nrace. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept up on\nus and first thing you know——”’\n“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he\nadvised me.\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and\na few minutes later I got up to go home. They came\nto the door with me and stood side by side in a\ncheerful square of light. As I started my motor\nDaisy peremptorily called: “Wait!\n“T forgot to ask you something, and it’s impor-\ntant. We heard you were engaged to a girl out\nWest.”\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. ‘We\nheard that you were engaged.”\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me\nby opening up again in a flower-like way. “We\nheard it from three people, so it must be true.”\nOf course I knew what they were referring to,\nbut I wasn’t even vaguely engaged. The fact that\ngossip had published the banns was one of the rea-\nsons I had come East. You can’t stop going with\nan old friend on account of rumors, and on the\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 25\nother hand I had no intention of being rumored\ninto marriage.\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them\nless remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and\na little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me\nthat the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the\nhouse, child in arms—but apparently there were no\nsuch intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact\nthat he ‘‘had some woman in New York” was really\nless surprising than that he had been depressed by\na book. Something was making him nibble at the\nedge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism\nno longer nourished his peremptory heart.\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs\nand in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-\npumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached\nmy estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed\nand sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in\nthe yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud,\nbright night, with wings beating in the trees and a\npersistent organ sound as the full bellows of the\nearth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a\nmoving cat wavered across the moonlight, and turn-\ning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone\n—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the\nshadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing\nwith his hands in his pockets regarding the silver\npepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon\n\n26 THE GREAT GATSBY\nthe lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself,\ncome out to determine what share was his of our\nlocal heavens.\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had men-\ntioned him at dinner, and that would do for an in-\ntroduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he gave a\nsudden intimation that he was content to be alone\n—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water\nin a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I\ncould have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I\nglanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except\na single green light, minute and far away, that might\nhave been the end of a dock. When I looked once\nmore for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone\nagain in the unquiet darkness.\n\nCHAPTER II\nAxout half way between West Egg and New York\nthe motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs\nbeside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away\nfrom a certain desolate area of land. This is a val-\nley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like\nwheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens;\nwhere ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys\nand rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent\neffort, of ash-gray men, who move dimly and already\ncrumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a\nline of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives\nout a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and imme-\ndiately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden\nspades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which\nscreens their obscure operations from your sight.\nBut above the gray land and the spasms of bleak\ndust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive,\nafter a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.\nThe eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\ngigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They\nlook out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of\nenormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-\nexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an\noculist set them there to fatten his practice in the\n27\n\n28 THE GREAT GATSBY\nborough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved\naway. But his eyes, dimmed al ittle by many paint-\nless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the\nsolemn dumping ground.\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a\nsmall foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up\nto let barges through, the passengers on waiting\ntrains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as\nhalf an hour. There is always a halt there of at\nleast a minute, and it was because of this that I\nfirst met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon\nwherever he was known. His acquaintances re-\nsented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés\nwith her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered\nabout, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though\nI was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her\n—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon, and when we stopped by\nthe ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold\nof my elbow, literally forced me from the car.\n“We're getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to\nmeet my girl.”\nI think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and\nhis determination to have my company bordered\non violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\nI followed him over a low whitewashed railroad\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 29\nfence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the\nroad under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The\nonly building in sight was a small block of yellow\nbrick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of\ncompact Main Street ministering to it, and contigu-\nous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it\ncontained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant, approached bya t rail of ashes; the third\nwas a garage—Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars\nbought and sold.—and I followed Tom inside.\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only\ncar visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford\nwhich crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to\nme that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and\nthat sumptuous and romantic apartments were con-\ncealed overhead, when the proprietor himself ap-\npeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man,\nanemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us\na damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue\neyes.\n“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping\nhim jovially on the shoulder. ‘‘How’s business?”\n“T can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvinc-\ningly. ‘When are you going to sell me that car?”\n“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it\nnow.”\n“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”\n““No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. ‘‘And if you\n\n30 THE GREAT GATSBY\nfeel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it some-\nwhere else after all.”\n“T don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly.\n“T just meant——”\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently\naround the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a\nstairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door.\nShe was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but\nshe carried her flesh sensuously as some women can.\nHer face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crépe-\nde-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty,\nbut there was an immediately perceptible vitality\nabout her as if the nerves of her body were continu-\nally smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking\nthrough her husband as if he were a ghost, shook\nhands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.\nThen she wet her lips, and without turning around\nspoke to her husband ina soft, coarse voice:\n““Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody\ncan sit down.”\n“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went\ntoward the little office, mingling immediately with\nthe cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust\nveiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled\neverything in the vicinity—except his wife, who\nmoved close to Tom.\n“‘T want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on\nthe next train.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 31\n“All right.”\n“T’ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower\nlevel.”\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as\nGeorge Wilson emerged with two chairs from his\noffice door.\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight.\nIt was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a\ngray, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in\na row along the railroad track.\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging\na frown with Doctor Eckleburg.\n“ Awful.”\n“Tt does her good to get away.”\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in\nNew York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s\nalive.”\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up to-\ngether to New York—or not quite together, tor Mrs.\nWilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred\nthat much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers\nwho might be on the train.\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured\nmuslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide\nhips as Tom helped her to the platform in New\nYork. At the news-stand she bought a copy of Town\nTattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the\nstation drug-store some cold cream and a small\n\n32 THE GREAT GATSBY\nflask of perfume. Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing\ndrive she let four taxicabs drive away before she\nselected a new one, lavender-colored with gray up-\nholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of\nthe station into the glowing sunshine. But im-\nmediately she turned sharply from the window and,\nleaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\n“T want to get one of those dogs,” she said ear-\nnestly. ‘I want to get one forthe apartment. They’re\nnice to have—a dog.”\nWe backed up to a gray old man who bore an\nabsurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a\nbasket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson\neagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n*1’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t\nsuppose you got that kind?”\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket,\nplunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling,\nby the back of the neck.\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man\nwith disappointment in his voice. ‘‘It’s more of an\nAiredale.”’ He passed his hand over the brown wash-\nrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat.\nThat’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching\ncold.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 33\n“T think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusias-\ntically. “How much is it?”\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That\ndog will cost you ten dollars.”\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale\nconcerned in it somewhere, though its feet were\nstartlingly white—changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weather-\nproof coat with rapture.\n“Ts it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. ‘“‘Here’s your\nmoney. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft,\nalmost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon.\nI wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock\nof white sheep turn the corner.\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you\nhere.”\n“No, you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly.\n“Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the\napartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Come on,” she urged. “‘I’ll telephone my sister\nCatherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by peo-\nple who ought to know.”\n“Well, I'd like to, but——”\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park\ntoward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the\ncab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\n\n34 THE GREAT GATSBY\napartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming\nglance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gath-\nered up her dog and her other purchases, and went\nhaughtily in.\n“Ym going to have the McKees come up,” she\nannounced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of\ncourse, I got to call up my sister, too.”\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small\nliving-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom,\nand a bath. The living-room was crowded to the\ndoors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too\nlarge for it, so that to move about was to stumble\ncontinually over scenes of ladies swinging in the\ngardens of Versailles. The only picture was an\nover-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting\non a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, how-\never, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the\ncountenance of a stout old lady beamed down into\nthe room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on\nthe table together with a copy of “Simon Called\nPeter,”’ and some of the small scandal magazines of\nBroadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box\nfull of straw and some milk, to which he added on\nhis own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits—\none of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out\na bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.\nI have been drunk just twice in my life, and the\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 35\nsecond time was that afternoon; so everything that\nhappened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although\nuntil after eight o’clock the apartment was full of\ncheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson\ncalled up several people on the telephone; then there\nwere no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at\nthe drugstore on the corner. When I came back\nthey had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly\nin the living-room and read a chapter of “Simon\nCalled Peter”—either it was terrible stuff or the\nwhiskey distorted things, because it didn’t make\nany sense to me.\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs.\nWilson and I called each other by our first names)\nreappeared, company commenced to arrive at the\napartment-door.\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl\nof about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair,\nand a complexion powdered milky white. Her eye-\nbrows had been plucked and then drawn on again\nat a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature\ntoward the restoration of the old alignment gave a\nblurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pot-\ntery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.\nShe came in with such a proprietary haste, and\nlooked around so possessively at the furniture that\nI wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her\nshe laughed immoderately, repeated my question\n\n36 THE GREAT GATSBY\naloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a\nhotel.\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the\nflat below. He had just shaved, for there was a\nwhite spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was\nmost respectful in his greeting to every one in the\nroom. He informed me that he was in the “‘artistic\ngame,” and I gathered later that he was a photog-\nrapher and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm\non the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome,\nand horrible. She told me with pride that her hus-\nband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-\nseven times since they had been married.\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time\nbefore, and was now attired in an elaborate after-\nnoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out\na continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had\nalso undergone a change. The intense vitality that\nhad been so remarkable in the garage was converted\ninto impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures,\nher assertions became more violently affected mo-\nment by moment, and as she expanded the room\ngrew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the\nsmoky air.\n““My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing\nshout, ‘‘most of these fellas will cheat you every\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 37\ntime. All they think of is money. I had a woman\nup here last week to look at my feet, and when she\ngave me the bill you’d of thought she had my\nappendicitus out.”\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs.\nMcKee.\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at\npeople’s feet in their own homes.”\n“T like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, ‘‘I\nthink it’s adorable.”\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising\nher eyebrow in disdain.\n“Tt’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip\nit on sometimes when I don’t care what I look\nlike.”\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know\nwhat I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester\ncould only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.”\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who re-\nmoved a strand of hair from over her eyes and\nlooked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side,\nand then moved his hand back and forth slowly in\nfront of his face.\n“T should change the light,” he said after a mo-\nment. ‘‘I’d like to bring out the modelling of the\nfeatures. And I’d try to get hold of all the back\nhair.”\n\n38 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried\nMrs. McKee. “IT think it’s ‘-\nHer husband said ‘‘S#!/” and we all looked at the\nsubject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned\naudibly and got to his feet.\n“Vou McKees have something to drink,” he said.\n“‘Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle,\nbefore everybody goes to sleep.”\n“T told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised\nher eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the\nlower orders. “These people! You have to keep\nafter them all the time.”\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then\nshe flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy,\nand swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen\nchefs awaited her orders there.\n“T’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,”\nasserted Mr. McKee.\nTom looked at him blankly.\n“Two of them we have framed down-stairs.”\n“Two what?” demanded Tom.\n“Two studies. One of them I call ‘Montauk\nPoint—The Gulls,’ and the other I call ‘Montauk\nPoint—The Sea.’”\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the\ncouch.\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too,” she in-\nquired.\n“T live at West Egg.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 39\n“Really? I was down there at a party about a\nmonth ago. At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you\nknow him?”\n“T live next door to him.”\n“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of\nKaiser Wilhelm’s. That’s where all his money comes\nfrom.”\n“Really?”\nShe nodded.\n“Vm scared of him. I’d hate to have him get\nanything on me.”\nThis absorbing information about my neighbor\nwas interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly\nat Catherine:\n“Chester, I think you could do something with\nher,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nod-\nded in a bored way, and turned his attention to\nTom.\n“T’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I\ncould get the entry. All I ask is that they should\ngive me as tart.”\n“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short\nshout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a\ntray. ‘She'll give you a letter of introduction, won’t\nyou, Myrtle?”\n“Do what?” she asked, startled.\n“You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to\nyour husband, so he can do some studies of him.”\nHis lips moved silently for a moment as he invented.\n\n40 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“*George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or\nsomething like that.”\nCatherine leaned close to me and whispered in\nmy ear:\n“Neither of them can stand the person they’re\nmarried to.”\n“Can’t they?”\n“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and\nthen at Tom. “What I say is, why go on living\nwith them if they can’t stand them? If I was them\nI’d get a divorce and get married to each other\nright away.”\n““Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”\nThe answer to this was unexpected. It came from\nMyrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was\nviolent and obscene.\n“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She\nlowered her voice again. “It’s really his wife that’s\nkeeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, and they\ndon’t believe in divorce.”\nDaisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little\nshocked at the elaborateness of the lie.\n“When they do get married,” continued Cath-\nerine, “‘they’re going West to live for a while until\nit blows over.”\n“It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.”\n“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed sur-\nprisingly. “I just got back from Monte Carlo.”\n“Really.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 41\n“Just last year. I went over there with another\ngirl.”\n“Stay long?”\n“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.\nWe went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve\nhundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped\nout of it all in two days in the private rooms. We\nhad an awful time getting back, I can tell you.\nGod, how I hated that town!”\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window\nfor a moment like the blue honey of the Mediter-\nranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called\nme back into the room.\n“TY almost made a mistake, too,” she declared\nvigorously. “I almost married a little kyke who’d\nbeen after me for years. I knew he was below me.\nEverybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s\n’way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d\nof got me sure.”\n“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her\nhead up and down, “‘at least you didn’t marry him.”\n“T know I didn’t.”\n“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously.\n‘And that’s the difference between your case and\nmine.”\n“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine.\n“Nobody forced you to.”\nMyrtle considered.\n“‘T married him because I thought he was a gen-\n\n42 THE GREAT GATSBY\ntleman,” she said finally. “I thought he knew\nsomething about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick\nmy shoe.”\n“You were crazy about him for a while,” said\nCatherine.\n“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously.\n“Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any\nmore crazy about him than I was about that man\nthere.”\nShe pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked\nat me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression\nthat I expected no affection.\n“The only crazy I was was when I married him.\nI knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed\nsomebody’s best suit to get married in, and never\neven told me about it, and the man came after it one\nday when he was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I\nsaid. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I\ngave it to him and then I lay down and cried to\nbeat the band all afternoon.”\n“She really ought to get away from him,” re-\nsumed Catherine to me. ‘“‘They’ve been living over\nthat garage for eleven years. And Tom’s the first\nsweetie she ever had.”\nThe bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now\nin constant demand by all present, excepting Cath-\nerine, who “felt just as good on nothing at all.”\nTom rang for the janitor and sent him for some\ncelebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 43\nin themselves. I wanted to get out and walk east-\nward toward the park through the soft twilight, but\neach time I tried to go I became entangled in some\nwild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if\nwith ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city\nour line of yellow windows must have contributed\ntheir share of human secrecy to the casual watcher\nin the darkening streets, and I saw him too, look-\ning up and wondering. I was within and without,\nsimultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inex-\nhaustible variety of life.\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and sud-\ndenly her warm breath poured over me the story\nof her first meeting with Tom.\n“Tt was on the two little seats facing each other\nthat are always the last ones left on the train. I\nwas going up to New York to see my sister and\nspend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent\nleather shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him,\nbut every time he looked at me I had to pretend\nto be looking at the advertisement over his head.\nWhen we came into the station he was next to me,\nand his white shirt-front pressed against my arm,\nand so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but\nhe knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got\ninto a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t\ngetting into a subway train. All I kept thinking\nabout, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever;\nyou can’t live forever.’”\n\n44 THE GREAT GATSBY\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang\nfull of her artificial laughter.\n“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you\nthis dress as soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got\nto get another one to-morrow. I’m going to make\na list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage\nand a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of\nthose cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring,\nand a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s\ngrave that'll last all summer. I got to write down\na list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.”\nIt was nine o’clock—almost immediately after-\nward I looked at my watch and found it was ten.\nMr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of\naction. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from\nhis cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried\nme all the afternoon.\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking\nwith blind eyes through the smoke, and from time\nto time groaning faintly. People disappeared, re-\nappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then\nlost each other, searched for each other, found each\nother a few feet away. Some time toward midnight\nTom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face\ndiscussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs.\nWilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name.\n“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson.\n“T’ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai a\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 45\nMaking a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan\nbroke her nose with his open hand.\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bath-\nroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high\nover the confusion a long broken wail of pain.\nMr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a\ndaze toward the door. When he had gone half way\nhe turned around and stared at the scene—his wife\nand Catherine scolding and consoling as they stum-\nbled here and there among the crowded furniture\nwith articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the\ncouch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy\nof Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.\nThen Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the\ndoor. Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.\n“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we\ngroaned down in the elevator.\n“Where?”\n“‘A nywhere.”\n“‘Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the ele-\nvator boy.\n“JT beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dig-\nnity, “I didn’t know I was touching it.”\n“All right,” I agreed, “I'll be glad to.”\n. .. | was standing beside his bed and he was sit-\nting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear,\nwith a great portfolio in his hands.\n“Beauty and the Beast . . .

In his blue gardens men and\ngirls came and went like moths among the whisper-\nings and the champagne and the stars. At high\ntide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving\nfrom the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the\nhot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit\nthe waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over\ncataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce\nbecame an omnibus, bearing parties to and from\nthe city between nine in the morning and long past\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a\nbrisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mon-\ndays eight servants, including an extra gardener,\ntoiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and\nhammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages\nof the night before.\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons\narrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Mon-\nday these same oranges and lemons left his back\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a\nmachine in the kitchen which could extract the\njuice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a\nlittle button was pressed two hundred times by a\nbutler’s thumb.\n47\n\n48 THE GREAT GATSBY\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came\ndown with several hundred feet of canvas and\nenough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of\nGatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, gar-\nnished with glistening hors-d’ceuvre, spiced baked\nhams crowded against salads of harlequin designs\nand pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark\ngold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail\nwas set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and\nwith cordials so long forgotten that most of his\nfemale guests were too young to know one from\nanother.\nBy seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no\nthin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and\ntrombones and saxophones and viols and cornets\nand piccolos, and low and high drums. The last\nswimmers have come in from the beach now and\nare dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are\nparked five deep in the drive, and already the\nhalls and salons and verandas are gaudy with\nprimary colors, and hair bobbed in strange new\nways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.\nThe bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of\ncocktails permeate the garden outside, until the\nair is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual\ninnuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot,\nand enthusiastic meetings between women who\nnever knew each other’s names.\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 49\naway from the sun, and now the orchestra is play-\ning yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices\npitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by\nminute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a\ncheerful word. The groups change more swiftly,\nswell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\nsame breath; already there are wanderers, confident\ngirls who weave here and there among the stouter\nand more stable, become for a sharp, joyous mo-\nment the centre of a group, and then, excited with\ntriumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces\nand voices and color under the constantly changing\nlight.\nSuddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal,\nseizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for\ncourage and, moving her hands like Frisco, dances\nout alone on the canvas platform. A momentary\nhush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm oblig-\ningly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the\nerroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s\nunderstudy from the Follies. The party has begun.\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gats-\nby’s house I was one of the few guests who had\nactually been invited. People were not invited—\nthey went there. They got into automobiles which\nbore them out to Long Island, and somehow they\nended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were\nintroduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and\nafter that they conducted themselves according to\n\n50 THE GREAT GATSBY\nthe rules of behavior associated with an amusement\npark. Sometimes they came and went without hav-\ning met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a\nsimplicity of heart that was its own ticket of ad-\nmission.\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a\nuniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early\nthat Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal\nnote from his employer: the honor would be entirely\nGatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party”\nthat night. He had seen me several times, and had\nintended to call on me long before, but a peculiar\ncombination of circumstances had prevented it—\nsigned Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his\nlawn a little after seven, and wandered around\nrather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people\nI didn’t know—though here and there was a face\nI had noticed on the commuting train. I was im-\nmediately struck by the number of young English-\nmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a\nlittle hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices\nto solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that\nthey were selling something: bonds or insurance or\nautomobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware\nof the easy money in the vicinity and convinced\nthat it was theirs for a few words in the right\nkey.\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 51\nmy host, but the two or three people of whom I\nasked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowl-\nedge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direc-\ntion of the cocktail table—the only place in the\ngarden where a single man could linger without\nlooking purposeless and alone.\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer\nembarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the\nhouse and stood at the head of the marble steps,\nleaning a little backward and looking with contemp-\ntuous interest down into the garden.\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach\nmyself to some one before I should begin to address\ncordial remarks to the passers-by.\n“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My\nvoice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\n“T thought you might be here,” she responded\nabsently as I came up. “I remembered you lived\nnext door to——”’\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that\nshe’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to\ntwo girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at\nthe foot of the steps.\n“Hello!” they cried together. ‘Sorry you didn’t\nwin.”\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost\nin the finals the week before.\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the\n\n52 THE GREAT GATSBY\ngirls in yellow, “but we met you here about a\nmonth ago.”\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked\nJordan, and I started, but the girls had moved\ncasually on and her remark was addressed to the pre-\nmature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out\nof a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden\narm resting in mine, we descended the steps and\nsauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails\nfloated at us through the twilight, and we sat down\nat a table with the two girls in yellow and three\nmen, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired\nJordan of the girl beside her.\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” an-\nswered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She\nturned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you,\nLucille?”\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n“T like to come,”’ Lucille said. ‘I never care what\nI do, so I always have a good time. When I was here\nlast I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me\nmy name and address—inside of a week I got a\npackage from Croirier’s with a new evening gown\nin it.”\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n“Sure I did. I was going to wear it to-night, but\nit was too big in the bust and had to be altered.\nIt was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred\nand sixty-five dollars.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 53\n“There’s something funny about a fellow that'll\ndo a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly.\n“He doesn’t want any trouble with anybody.”\n“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n“Gatsby. Somebody told me——”\nThe two girls and Jordan leaned together con-\nfidentially.\n“Somebody told me they thought he killed a\nman once.”\nA thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr.\nMumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.\n“T don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille\nsceptically; “it’s more that he was a German spy\nduring the war.”\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n“TY heard that from a man who knew all about\nhim, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us\npositively.\n“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “‘it couldn’t be that,\nbecause he was in the American army during the\nwar.” As our credulity switched back to her she\nleaned forward with enthusiasm. ‘You look at him\nsometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him.\nVl bet he killed a man.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shiv-\nered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.\nIt was testimony to the romantic speculation he in-\nspired that there were whispers about him from\nthose who had found little that it was necessary to\nwhisper about in this world.\n\n54 THE GREAT GATSBY\nThe first supper—there would be another one\nafter midnight—was now being served, and Jordan\ninvited me to join her own party, who were spread\naround a table on the other side of the garden.\nThere were three married couples and Jordan’s es-\ncort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent\ninnuendo, and obviously under the impression that\nsooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up\nher person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of\nrambling this party had preserved a dignified homo-\ngeneity, and assumed to itself the function of rep-\nresenting the staid nobility of the country-side—\nEast Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully\non guard against its spectroscopic gayety.\n“Tet’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a some-\nhow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is\nmuch too polite for me.”\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going\nto find the host: I had never met him, she said, and\nit was making me uneasy. The undergraduate\nnodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded,\nbut Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him\nfrom the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the\nveranda. On a chance we tried an important-look-\ning door, and walked into a high Gothic library,\npanelled with carved English oak, and probably\ntransported complete from some ruin overseas.\nA stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 55\neyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on\nthe edge of a great table, staring with unsteady con-\ncentration at the shelves of books. As we entered\nhe wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan\nfrom head to foot.\n“What do you think?” he demanded impetu-\nously.\n‘About what?”\nHe waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\n“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t\nbother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”\n“The books?”\nHe nodded.\n“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I\nthought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter\nof fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and— Here!\nLemme show you.”\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to\nthe bookcases and returned with Volume One of the\n“Stoddard Lectures.”\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide\npiece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s\na regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thorough-\nness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—\ndidn’t cut the pages. But what do you want?\nWhat do you expect?”\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it\nhastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was\nremoved the whole library was liable to collapse.\n\n56 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you\njust come? I was brought. Most people were\nbrought.”\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without\nanswering.\n“TY was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,”\nhe continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you\nknow her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve\nbeen drunk for about a week now, and I thought it\nmight sober me up to sit in a library.”\n“Has it?”\n“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only\nbeen here an hour. Did I tell you about the books?\nThey’re real. They’re——”\n“You told us.”\nWe shook hands with him gravely and went back\noutdoors.\nThere was dancing now on the canvas in the gar-\nden; old men pushing young girls backward in\neternal graceless circles, superior couples holding\neach other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in\nthe corners—and a great number of single girls danc-\ning individualistically or relieving the orchestra for\na moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps.\nBy midnight the hilarity had increased. A cele-\nbrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious\ncontralto had sung in jazz, and between the num-\nbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,\nwhile happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 57\nthe summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned\nout to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in cos-\ntume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger\nthan finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and\nfloating in the Sound was at riangle of silver scales,\ntrembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at\na table with a man of about my age and a rowdy\nlittle girl, who gave way upon the slightest provo-\ncation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying\nmyself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of cham-\npagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes\ninto something significant, elemental, and profound.\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at\nme and smiled.\n“Your face is familiar,”’ he said, politely. “‘Weren’t\nyou in the First Division during the war?”\n“Why, yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infan-\ntry.”\n“J was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-\neighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, gray\nlittle villages in France. Evidently he lived in this\nvicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a\nhydroplane, and was going to try it out in the\nmorning.\n“‘Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the\nshore along the Sound.”\n\n58 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“What time?”\n‘Any time that suits you best.”\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name\nwhen Jordan looked around and smiled.\n“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n“Much better.” I turned again to my new ac-\nquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I\nhaven’t even seen the host. I live over there—”’\nI waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the dis-\ntance, ‘‘and this man Gatsby sent over his chauf-\nfeur with an invitation.”\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to\nunderstand.\n“T’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n“What!” I exclaimed. ‘“‘Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n“T thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid ’'m\nnot a very good host.”\nHe smiled understandingly—much more than un-\nderstandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with\na quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may\ncome across four or five times in life. It faced—or\nseemed to face—the whole eternal world for an in-\nstant, and then concentrated on you with_an irresis-\ntible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just\nso far as you wanted to be understood, believed in\nyou as you would like to believe in yourself, and as-\nsured you that it had precisely the impression of you\nthat, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely\nat that point it vanished—and I was looking at an\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 59\nelegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty,\nwhose elaborate formality of speech just missed\nbeing absurd. Some time before he introduced him-\nself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking\nhis words with care.\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified\nhimself a butler hurried toward him with the infor-\nmation that Chicago was calling him on the wire.\nHe excused himself with a small bow that included\neach of us in turn.\n“Tf you want anything just ask for it, old sport,”\nhe urged me. “‘Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jor-\ndan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I\nhad expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n“Who is he?’”’ I demanded. “Do you know?”\n“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he\ndo?”\n“Now yow’re started on the subject,” she an-\nswered with a wan smile. “Well, he told me once\nhe was an Oxford man.”\nA dim background started to take shape behind\nhim, but at her next remark it faded away.\n‘However, I don’t believe it.”\n“Why not?”\n“T don’t know,” she insisted, ‘‘I just don’t think\nhe went there.”\n\n60 THE GREAT GATSBY\nSomething in her tone reminded me of the other\ngirl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect\nof stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted\nwithout question the information that Gatsby sprang\nfrom the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower\nEast Side of New York. That was comprehensible.\nBut young men didn’t—at least in my provincial\ninexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out\nof nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan,\nchanging the subject with an urban distaste for the\n\" concrete. “And I like large parties. They’re so in-\ntimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\nThere was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice\nof the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the\nchatter of the garden.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “‘At the re-\nquest of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you\nMr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which attracted\nso much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If\nyou read the papers you know there was a big sen-\nsation.”” He smiled with jovial condescension, and\nadded: “Some sensation!’’ Whereupon everybody\nlaughed.\n“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as\n‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World.’”\nThe nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded\nme, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby,\nstanding alone on the marble steps and looking from\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 61\none group to another with approving eyes. His tanned\nskin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his\nshort hair looked as though it were trimmed every\nday. I could see nothing sinister about him. I won-\ndered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to\nset him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that\nhe grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity in-\ncreased. When the ‘‘Jazz History of the World” was\nover, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoul-\nders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swoon-\ning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into\ngroups, knowing that some one would arrest their\nfalls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby,\nand no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and\nno singing quartets were formed for Gatsby’s head\nfor one link.\n“T beg your pardon.”\nGatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon,\nbut Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”\n“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.\n“Yes, madame.”\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in\nastonishment, and followed the butler toward the\nhouse. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress,\nall her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a\njauntiness about her movements as if she had first\nlearned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp\nmornings.\n\n62 THE GREAT GATSBY\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time\nconfused and intriguing sounds had issued from a\nlong, many-windowed room which overhung the\nterrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was\nnow engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two\nchorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I\nwent inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the\ngirls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside\nher stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a\nfamous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a\nquantity of champagne, and during the course of\nher song she had decided, ineptly, that everything\nwas very, very sad—she was not only singing, she\nwas weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in\nthe song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs,\nand then took up the lyric again in a quavering so-\nprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not\nfreely, however, for when they came into contact\nwith her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed\nan inky color, and pursued the rest of their way\nin slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was\nmade that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon\nshe threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went\noff into a deep vinous sleep.\n“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her\nhusband,” explained a girl at my elbow.\nTI looked around. Most of the remaining women\nwere now having fights with men said to be their\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 63\nhusbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from\nEast Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One\nof the men was talking with curious intensity to\na young actress, and his wife, after attempting to\nlaugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\nway, broke down entirely and resorted to flank at-\ntacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his\nside like an angry diamond, and hissed: ‘‘ You prom-\nised!” into his ear.\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to\nwayward men. The hall was at present occupied\nby two deplorably sober men and their highly in-\ndignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with\neach other in slightly raised voices.\n“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he\nwants to go home.”\n“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”\n““We’re always the first ones to leave.”\n“So are we.”\n“Well, we’re almost the last to-night,’”’ said one\nof the men sheepishly. “The orchestra left half an\nhour ago.”\nIn spite of the wives’ agreement that such ma-\nlevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended\nin a short struggle, and both wives were lifted,\nkicking, into the night.\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the\nlibrary opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came\nout together. He was saying some last word to her,\n\n64 THE GREAT GATSBY\nbut the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly\ninto formality as several people approached him to\nsay good-by.\nJordan’s party were calling impatiently to her\nfrom the porch, but she lingered for a moment to\nshake hands.\n“T’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she\nwhispered. ‘‘How long were we in there?”\n“Why, about an hour.”\n“Tt was... simply amazing,” she repeated ab-\nstractedly. “‘But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here\nI am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully in my\nface. ‘Please come and see me. ... Phone book.\n... Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard.\n... My aunt....” She was hurrying off as she\ntalked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as\nshe melted into her party at the door.\nRather ashamed that on my first appearance I\nhad stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s\nguests, who were clustered around him. I wanted\nto explain that I’d hunted for him early in the eve-\nning and to apologize for not having known him in\nthe garden.\n“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly.\n“Don’t give it another thought, old sport.” The\nfamiliar expression held no more familiarity than\nthe hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder.\n“And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane\nto-morrow morning, at nine o’clock.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 65\nThen the butler, behind his shoulder:\n“Philadelphia wants you on the ’phone, sir.”\n“All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right\nthere. . . . Good night.”\n“Good night.”\n“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there\nseemed to be a pleasant significance in having been\namong the last to go, as if he had desired it all the\ntime. “‘Good night, old sport. . . . Good night.”\nBut as I walked down the steps I saw that the\nevening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the\ndoor a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and\ntumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road,\nright side up, but violently shorn of one wheel,\nrested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive\nnot two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall\naccounted for the detachment of the wheel, which\nwas now getting considerable attention from half a\ndozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had\nleft their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant\ndin from those in the rear had been audible for some\ntime, and added to the already violent confusion of\nthe scene.\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the\nwreck and now stood in the middle of the road, look-\ning from the car to the tire and from the tire to the\nobservers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\n“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I\n\n66 THE GREAT GATSBY\nrecognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and\nthen the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s\nlibrary.\n“How'd it happen?”\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n“T know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he\nsaid decisively.\n“But how did it happen? Did you run into the\nwall?”\n“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands\nof the whole matter. “I know very little about\ndriving—next to nothing. It happened, and that’s\nall I know.”\n“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to\ntry driving at night.”\n“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indig-\nnantly, ‘I wasn’t even trying.”\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\n“Do you want to commit suicide?”\n“You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver\nand not even irying!”\n“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal.\n“T wasn’t driving. There’s another man in the car.”\nThe shock that followed this declaration found\nvoice in a sustained “‘Ah-h-h!”’ as the door of the\ncoupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was now a\ncrowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the\ndoor had opened wide there was a ghostly pause.\nThen, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 67\nindividual stepped out of the wreck, pawing ten-\ntatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing\nshoe.\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and con-\nfused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the\napparition stood swaying for a moment before he\nperceived the man in the duster.\n‘“‘Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we\nrun outa gas?”\n“Look !”\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated\nwheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then\nlooked upward as though he suspected that it had\ndropped from the sky.\n“Tt came off,” some one explained.\nHe nodded.\n“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straight-\nening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined\nvoice:\n“‘Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line sta-\ntion?”\nAt least a dozen men, some of them al ittle better\noff than he was, explained to him that wheel and\ncar were no longer joined by any physical bond.\n“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put\nher in reverse.”\n“But the wheel’s off!”\nHe hesitated.\n\n68 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“No harm in trying,” he said.\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo\nand I turned away and cut across the lawn toward\nhome. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon\nwas shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night\nfine as before, and surviving the laughter and the\nsound of his still glowing garden. A sudden empti-\nness seemed to flow now from the windows and the\ngreat doors, endowing with complete isolation the\nfigure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand\nup in a formal gesture of farewell.\nReading over what I have written so far, I see I\nhave given the impression that the events of three\nnights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me.\nOn the contrary, they were merely casual events\nin a crowded summer, and, until much later, they\nabsorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning\nthe sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried\ndown the white chasms of lower New York to the\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young\nbond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched\nwith them in dark, crowded restaurants on little\npig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I\neven had a short affair with a girl who lived in\nJersey City and worked in the accounting depart-\nment, but her brother began throwing mean looks\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 69\nin my direction, so when she went on her vacation\nin July I let it blow quietly away.\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some\nreason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and\nthen I went up-stairs to the library and studied in-\nvestments and securities for a conscientious hour.\nThere were generally a few rioters around, but they\nnever came into the library, so it was a good place\nto work. After that, if the night was mellow, I\nstrolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray\nHill Hotel, and over 33d Street to the Pennsylvania\nStation.\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous\nfeel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the con-\nstant flicker of men and women and machines gives\nto the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue\nand pick out romantic women from the crowd and\nimagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter\ninto their lives, and no one would ever know or dis-\napprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them\nto their apartments on the corners of hidden streets,\nand they turned and smiled back at me before they\nfaded through a door into warm darkness. At the\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting\nloneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor\nyoung clerks who loitered in front of windows wait-\ning until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner\n—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poign-\nant moments of night and life.\n\n70 THE GREAT GATSBY\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the\nForties were lined five deep with throbbing taxi-\ncabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking\nin my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as\nthey waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter\nfrom unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made un-\nintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was\nhurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then\nin midsummer I found her again. At first I was\nflattered to go places with her, because she was a\ngolf champion, and every one knew her name.\nThen it was something more. I wasn’t actually in\nlove, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The pored\nhaughty face that she turned to the world concealed\nsomething—most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don’t in the beginning\n—and one day I found what it was. When we were\non a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\nborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and\nthen lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the\nstory about her that had eluded me that night at\nDaisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers—a sugges-\ntion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in\nthe semi-final round. The thing approached the\nproportions of a scandal—then died away. A\ncaddy retracted his statement, and the only other\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 71\nwitness admitted that he might have been mis-\ntaken. The incident and the name had remained\ntogether in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd\nmen, and now I saw that this was because she felt\nsafer on a plane where any divergence from a code\nwould be thought impossible. She was incurably\ndishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a\ndisadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I sup-\npose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent\nsmile turned to the world and yet satisfy the de-\nmands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a\nwoman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was\ncasually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversa-\ntion about driving a car. It started because she\npassed so close to some workmen that our fender\nflicked a button on one man’s coat.\n“You're a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you\nought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive\nat all.”\n“T am careful.”\n“No, you’re not.”\n‘Well, other people are,”’ she said lightly.\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\n“They'll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It\ntakes two to make an accident.”\n\n72 THE GREAT GATSBY\n‘“‘Suppose you met somebody just as careless as\nyourself.”\n“T hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate care-\nless people. That’s why I like you.”\nHer gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead,\nbut she had deliberately shifted our relations, and\nfor a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-\nthinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get\nmyself definitely out of that tangle back home.\nI'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: ‘Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was\nhow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint\nmustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip.\nNevertheless there was a vague understanding that\nhad to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the\ncardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the\nfew honest people that I have ever known.\n\nCHAPTER IV\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the\nvillages alongshore, the world and its mistress re-\nturned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously\non his lawn.\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, mov-\ning somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.\n“‘One time he killed a man who had found out that\nhe was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second\ncousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and\npour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-\ntable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s\nhouse that summer. It is an old time-table now, dis-\nintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule\nin effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the\ngray names, and they will give you a better impres-\nsion than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute\nof knowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers\nand the Leeches, and a man named Bunsen, whom\nI knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who was\ndrowned last summer up in Maine. And the Horn-\nbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and a whole clan\nnamed Blackbuck, who always gathered in a cor-\n73\n\n74 THE GREAT GATSBY\nner and flipped up their noses like goats at whoso-\never came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties\n(or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s\nwife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say,\nturned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no\ngood reason at all.\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remem-\nber. He came only once, in white knickerbockers,\nand had a fight with a bum named Etty in the\ngarden. From farther out on the Island came the\nCheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the\nStonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fish-\nguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three\ndays before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk\nout on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s\nautomobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies\ncame, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over\nsixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads,\nand Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys\nand Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick\nthe State senator and Newton Orchid, who con-\ntrolled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and\nClyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Ar-\nthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one\nway or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs\nand G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who\nafterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the pro-\nmoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 75\n. (“Rot-Gut”’) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest\n-Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wan-\ndered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out\nand Associated Traction would have to fluctuate\nprofitably next day.\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often\nand so long that he became known as “‘the boarder”\n—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical\npeople there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Dona-\nvan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and\nFrancis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes\nand the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel\nBetty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the\nDewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the\nSmirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and\nHenry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping\nin front of a subway train in Times Square.\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four\ngirls. They were never quite the same ones in physi-\ncal person, but they were so identical one with an-\nother that it inevitably seemed they had been there\nbefore. I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I\nthink, or else Consuela, or Gloria or Judy or June,\nand their last names were either the melodious\nnames of flowers and months or the sterner ones\nof the great American capitalists whose cousins, if\npressed, they would confess themselves to be.\nIn addition to all these I can remember that\nFaustina O’Brien came there at least once and the\n\n76 THE GREAT GATSBY\nBaedeker girls and young Brewer, who had his nose\nshot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss\nHaag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr.\nP. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and\nMiss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be her\nchauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we\ncalled Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I\nhave forgotten.\nAll these people came to Gatsby’s house in the\nsummer.\nAt nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gats-\nby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my\ndoor and gave out a burst of melody from its three-\nnoted horn. It was the first time he had called on\nme, though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted\nin his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,\nmade frequent use of his beach.\n“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch\nwith me to-day and I thought we’d ride up to-\ngether.”\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his\ncar with that resourcefulness of movement that is so\npeculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with\nthe absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,\nwith the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic\ngames. This quality was continually breaking\nthrough his punctilious manner in the shape of rest-\nlessness. He was never quite still; there was always\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 77\na tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening\nand closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“Tt’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off\nto give me a better view. “‘Haven’t you ever seen\nit before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich\ncream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and\nthere in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-\nboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and ter-\nraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored\na dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of\nglass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we\nstarted to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times\nin the past month and found, to my disappointment,\nthat he had little to say. So my first impression, that\nhe was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the pro-\nprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We\nhadn’t reached West Egg Village before Gatsby\nbegan leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and\nslapping himself indecisively on the knee of his\ncaramel-colored suit.\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly,\n“‘what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized eva-\nsions which that question deserves.\n\n78 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my\nlife,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a\nwrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that\nflavored conversation in his halls.\n“T’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand sud-\ndenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “TI\nam the son of some wealthy people in the Middle\nWest—all dead now. I was brought up in America\nbut educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors\nhave been educated there for many years. It is a\nfamily tradition.”\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jor-\ndan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried\nthe phrase ‘educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it,\nor choked on it, as though it had bothered him be-\nfore. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell\nto pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something\na little sinister about him, after all.\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired\ncasually.\n“San Francisco.”\n“T see.”\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal\nof money.”\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that\nsudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For\na moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg,\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 79\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the\ncapitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collect-\ning jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, paint-\ning a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me\nlong ago.”\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredu-\nlous laughter. The very phrases were worn so\nthreadbare that they evoked no image except that\nof a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every\npore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de\nBoulogne.\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great\nrelief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to\nbear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission\nas first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne\nForest I took the remains of my machine-gun bat-\ntalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap\non either side of us where the infantry couldn’t\nadvance. We stayed there two days and two nights,\na hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns,\nand when the infantry came up at last they found\nthe insignia of three German divisions among the\npiles of dead. I was promoted to be a major, and\nevery Allied government gave me a decoration—even\nMontenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adri-\natic Sea!”\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and\nnodded at them—with his smile. The smile compre-\n\n80 THE GREAT GATSBY\nhended Montenegro’s troubled history and sym-\npathized with the brave struggles of the Montene-\ngrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of na-\ntional circumstances which had elicited this tribute\nfrom Montenegro’s warm little heart. My incredul-\nity was submerged in fascination now; it was like\nskimming hastily through a dozen magazines.\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal,\nslung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.\n“That’s the one from Montenegro.”\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic\nlook. “Orderi di Danilo,” ran the circular legend,\n“Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”\n“Turn it.”\n“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Ex-\ntraordinary.”\n“‘Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir\nof Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the\nman on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men\nin blazers loafing in an archway through which were\nvisible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking\na little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in\nhis hand.\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers\nflaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw\nhim opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their\ncrimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken\nheart.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 81\n“T’m going to make a big request of you to-day,”\nhe said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction,\n““so I thought you ought to know something about\nme. I didn’t want you to think I was just some no-\nbody. You see, I usually find myself among stran-\ngers because I drift here and there trying to forget\nthe sad thing that happened to me.” He hesitated.\n“You'll hear about it this afternoon.”\n“At lunch?”\n“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that\nyou’re taking Miss Baker to tea.”\n“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”\n“No, old sport, ’m not. But Miss Baker has\nkindly consented to speak to you about this matter.”\nT hadn’t the faintest idea what ‘‘this matter” was,\nbut I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t\nasked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay\nGatsby. I was sure the request would be something\nutterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’'d\never set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.\nHe wouldn’t say another word. His correctness\ngrew on him as we neared the city. We passed\nPort Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-\nbelted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled\nslum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the\nfaded-gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of\nashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had\na glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage\npump with panting vitality as we went by.\n\n82 THE GREAT GATSBY\nWith fenders spread like wings we scattered light\nthrough half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted\namong the pillars of the elevated I heard the fa-\nmiliar “jug-jug-spat/” of a motorcycle, and a fran-\ntic policeman rode alongside.\n“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed\ndown. Taking a white card from his wallet, he\nwaved it before the man’s eyes.\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping\nhis cap. ‘Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Ex-\ncuse me!”\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of\nOxford?”\n“‘T was able to do the commissioner a favor once,\nand he sends me a Christmas card every year.”\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through\nthe girders making a constant flicker upon the mov-\ning cars, with the city rising up across the river in\nwhite heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish\nout of non-olfactory money. The city seen from\nthe Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for\nthe first time, in its first wild promise of all the mys-\ntery and the beauty in the world.\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with\nblooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds,\nand by more cheerful carriages for friends. The\nfriends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and\nshort upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was\nglad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 83\nincluded in their sombre holiday. As we crossed\nBlackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by\na white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes,\ntwo bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks\nof their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over\nthis bridge,”’ I thought; “‘anything at all... .”\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particu-\nlar wonder.\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second\nStreet cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away\nthe brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked\nhim out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to an-\nother man.\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfs-\nhiem.”\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and\nregarded me with two fine growths of hair which\nluxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I dis-\ncovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\n“So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfs-\nhiem, shaking my hand earnestly, “‘and what do\nyou think I did?”\n“What?” I inquired politely.\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he\ndropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his ex-\npressive nose.\n“TY handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid:\n\n84 THE GREAT GATSBY\n‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till\nhe shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved for-\nward into the restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem\nswallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed\ninto a somnambulatory abstraction.\n“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.\n“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfs-\nhiem, looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the\nceiling. ‘‘But I like across the street better!”\n“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr.\nWolfshiem: ‘It’s too hot over there.”’\n“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but\nfull of memories.”\n“What place is that?” I asked.\n“The old Metropole.”\n“The old Metropole,’ brooded Mr. Wolfshiem\ngloomily. ‘‘Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled\nwith friends gone now forever. I can’t forget so long\nas I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.\nIt was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and\ndrunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morn-\ning the waiter came up to him with a funny look\nand says somebody wants to speak to him outside.\n‘All right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I\npulled him down in his chair.\n“*Let the bastards come in here if they want you,\nRosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this\nroom.’\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 85\n“Tt was four o’clock in the morning then, and if\nwe'd of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”\n“Did he go?” I asked innocently.\n“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at\nme indignantly. ‘He turned around in the door and\nsays: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’\nThen he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot\nhim three times in his full belly and drove away.”\n“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remem-\nbering.\n“Five, with Becker.’ His nostrils turned to me in\nan interested way. ‘“‘I understand you’re looking for\na business gonnegtion.”\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was start-\nling. Gatsby answered for me:\n“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, ‘‘this isn’t the man.”\n“Noe?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\n“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about\nthat some other time.”\n“T beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “‘I had\na wrong man.”\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem,\nforgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the\nold Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy.\nHis eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around\nthe room—he completed the arc by turning to in-\nspect the people directly behind. I think that, ex-\ncept for my presence, he would have taken one\nshort glance beneath our own table.\n\n86 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Look here, old sport,’ said Gatsby, leaning\ntoward me, “‘I’m afraid I made you a little angry\nthis morning in the car.”\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out\nagainst it.\n“T don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I\ndon’t understand why you won’t come out frankly\nand tell me what you want. Why has it all got to\ncome through Miss Baker?”\n“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me.\n‘‘Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and\nshe’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up,\nand hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr.\nWolfshiem at the table.\n“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, fol-\nlowing him with his eyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he?\nHandsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.”\nce Yes.”’\n“He’s an Oggsford man.”\nce Oh !?\n“He went to Oggsford College in England. You\nknow Oggsford College?”\n“Tve heard of it.”\n“Tt’s one of the most famous colleges in the\nworld.”\n“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I\ninquired.\n“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 87\n‘“‘T made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after\nthe war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine\nbreeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to\nmyself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take\nhome and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ”\nHe paused. ‘‘I see you’re looking at my cuff but-\ntons.”\nI hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.\nThey were composed of oddly familiar pieces of\nivory.\n“Finest specimens of human molars,” he in-\nformed me.\n“Well!” I inspected them. ‘“‘That’s a very inter-\nesting idea.”\n“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.\n“Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women. He\nwould never so much as look at a friend’s wife.”\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned\nto the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his\ncoffee with a jerk and got to his feet.\n“T have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m\ngoing to run off from you two young men before I\noutstay my welcome.”\n“Don’t hurry, Meyer,” said Gatsby, without en-\nthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort\nof benediction.\n“You’re very polite, but I belong to another gen-\neration,” he announced solemnly. “‘ You sit here and\ndiscuss your sports and your young ladies and\n\n88 THE GREAT GATSBY\nyour—” He supplied an imaginary noun with an-\nother wave of his hand. “As for me, I am fifty years\nold, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.”\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic\nnose was trembling. I wondered if I had said any-\nthing to offend him.\n“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” ex--\nplained Gatsby. ‘This is one of his sentimental days.\nHe’s quite a character around New York—a denizen\nof Broadway.”\n“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”\nccN o.”\n“A dentist ?”\n“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby\nhesitated, then added coolly: “‘He’s the man who\nfixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course,\nthat the World’s Series had been fixed in 1910, but if\nI had thought of it at all I would have thought of it\nas a thing that merely happened, the end of some in-\nevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one\nman could start to play with the faith of fifty mil-\nlion people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar\nblowing a safe.\n“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after\na minute.\n“‘He just saw the opportunity.”\n“Why isn’t he in jail?”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 89\n“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart\nman.”\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter\nbrought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan\nacross the crowded room.\n“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve\ngot to say hello to some one.”\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a\ndozen steps in our direction.\n““Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly.\n‘‘Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”\n“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfa-\nmiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s\nface.\n“‘How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of\nme. “How’d you happen to come up this far to\neat?”\n“T’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer\nthere.\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen——\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very\nstraight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the\nPlaza Hotel)\n—TI was walking along from one place to another, half\non the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was hap-\n\ngo THE GREAT GATSBY\npier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit\ninto the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt\nalso that blew a little in the wind, and whenever\nthis happened the red, white, and blue banners in\nfront of all the houses stretched out stiff and said\ntut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the\nlawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just\neighteen, two years older than me, and by far the\nmost popular of all the young girls in Louisville.\nShe dressed in white, and had al ittle white roadster,\nand all day long the telephone rang in her house and\nexcited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded\nthe privilege of monopolizing her that night. “‘ Any-\nways, for an hour!”\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning\nher white roadster was beside the curb, and she was\nsitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before.\nThey were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t\nsee me until I was five feet away.\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. ‘Please\ncome here.”\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me,\nbecause of all the older girls I admired her most.\nShe asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and\nmake bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell\nthem that she couldn’t come that day? The of-\nficer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY gi\nway that every young girl wants to be looked at\nsometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I\nhave remembered the incident ever since. His\nname was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on him\nagain for over four years—even after I'd met him\non Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year\nI had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in\ntournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She\nwent with a slightly older crowd—when she went\nwith anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating\nabout her—how her mother had found her packing\nher bag one winter night to go to New York and\nsay good-by to a soldier who was going overseas.\nShe was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on\nspeaking terms with her family for several weeks.\nAfter that she didn’t play around with the soldiers\nany more, but only with a few flat-footed, short-\nsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into\nthe army at all.\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as\never. She had a début after the armistice, and in\nFebruary she was presumably engaged to a man\nfrom New Orleans. In June she married Tom\nBuchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and cir-\ncumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He\ncame down with a hundred people in four private\ncars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel,\nand the day before the wedding he gave her a string\n\n92 THE GREAT GATSBY\nof pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand\ndollars.\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half\nan hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying\non her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered\ndress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle\nof Sauterne in one hand anda l etter in the other.\n““’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a\ndrink before, but oh how I do enjoy it.”\n“What’s the matter, Daisy?”\nI was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen ag irl\nlike that before. ©\n“Here, deares’.” She groped around in a waste-\nbasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out\nthe string of pearls. “Take ’em down-stairs and\ngive ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em\nall Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’\nher mine!’”\nShe began to cry—sne cried and cried. I rushed\nout and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the\ndoor and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t\nlet go of the letter. She took it into the tub with\nher and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only\nlet me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that\nit was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn’t say another word. We gave her\nspirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and\nhooked her back into her dress, and half an hour\nlater, when we walked out of the room, the pearls\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 93\nwere around her neck and the incident was over.\nNext day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan\nwithout so much as a shiver, and started off on a\nthree months’ trip to the South Seas.\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came\nback, and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad\nabout her husband. If he left the room for a minute\nshe’d look around uneasily, and say: “‘Where’s Tom\ngone?”’ and wear the most abstracted expression\nuntil she saw him coming in the door. She used to\nsit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour,\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at\nhim with unfathomable delight. It was touching to\nsee them together—it made you laugh in a hushed,\nfascinated way. That was in August. A week after\nI left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the\nVentura road one night, and ripped a front wheel\noff his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers, too, because her arm was broken—she was\none of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara\nHotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they\nwent to France for a year. I saw them one spring\nin Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they\ncame back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was\npopular in Chicago, as you know. They moved\nwith a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and\nwild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect\nreputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s\n\n94 THE GREAT GATSBY\na great advantage not to drink among hard-drink-\ning people. You can hold your tongue, and, more-\nover, you can time any little irregularity of your\nown so that everybody else is so blind that they\ndon’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for\namour at all—and yet there’s something in that\nvoice of hers... .\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name\nGatsby for the first time in years. It was when I\nasked you—do you remember ?—if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came\ninto my room and woke me up, and said: ‘‘What\nGatsby?” and when I described him—I was half\nasleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must\nbe the man she used to know. It wasn’t until then\nthat I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her\nwhite car.\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this\nwe had left the Plaza for half an hour and were\ndriving in a victoria through Central Park. The\nsun had gone down behind the tall apartments of\nthe movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear\nvoices of children, already gathered like crickets on\nthe grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n“T’m the Sheik of Araby.\nYour love belongs to me.\nAt night when you’re asleep\nInto your tent I’ll creep——”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 95\n“Tt was a strange coincidence,” I said.\n“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”\n“Why not?”\n“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would\nbe just across the bay.”\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which\nhe had aspired on that June night. He came alive\nto me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his\npurposeless splendor.\n“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “‘if you’ll\ninvite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then\nlet him come over.”\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had\nwaited five years and bought a mansion where he\ndispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he\ncould ‘‘come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s\ngarden.\n“Did I have to know all this before he could ask\nsuch al ittle thing?”\n“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought\nyou might be offended. You see, he’s regular tough\nunderneath it all.”\nSomething worried me.\n“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”\n“He wants her to see his house,” she explained.\n“‘And your house is right next door.”\nce Oh !9\n“T think he half expected her to wander into one\nof his parties, some night,’’ went on Jordan, ‘‘but\n\n96 THE GREAT GATSBY\nshe never did. Then he began asking people casually\nif they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and\nyou should have heard the elaborate way he worked\nup to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a\nluncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:\n“**T don’t want to do anything out of the way!’\nhe kept saying. ‘I want to see her right next door.’\n“‘When I said you were a particular friend of\nTom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea. He\ndoesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says\nhe’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the\nchance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under al ittle\nbridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoul-\nder and drew her toward me and asked her to din-\nner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and\nGatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited\nperson, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who\nleaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort\nof heady excitement: “‘There are only the pursued,\nthe pursuing, the busy and the tired.”\n‘And Daisy ought to have something in her life,”’\nmurmured Jordan to me.\n“Does she want to see Gatsby?”\n“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t\nwant her to know. You’re just supposed to invite\nher to tea.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 97\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the\nfacade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale\nlight, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby\nand Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied\nface floated along the dark cornices and blinding\nsigns, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tighten-\ning my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and\nso I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.\n\nCHAPTER V\nWHEN I came home to West Egg that night I was\nafraid for a moment that my house was on fire.\nTwo o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light, which fell unreal on the\nshrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the\nroadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was\nGatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout\nthat had resolved itself into ‘“‘hide-and-go-seek”’\nor “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown\nopen to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only\nwind in the trees, which blew the wires and made\nthe lights go off and on again as if the house had\nwinked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned\naway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his\nlawn.\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently.\n‘‘T have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s\ngo to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”\n“Tt’s too late.”\n‘Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-\npool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”\n“T’ve got to go to bed.”\n98\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 99\n“All right.”\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eager-\nness.\n“T talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment.\n“T’m going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite\nher over here to tea.”\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t\nwant to put you to any trouble.”\n“What day would suit you?”\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me\nquickly. ‘I don’t want to put you to any trouble,\nyou see.”\n“How about the day after to-morrow?”\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with re-\nluctance:\n“T want to get the grass cut,” he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a\nsharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the\ndarker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected\nthat he meant my grass.\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncer-\ntainly, and hesitated.\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I\nasked.\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—”’’ He fumbled\nwith a series of beginnings. ‘Why, I thought—why,\nlook here, old sport, you don’t make much money,\ndo you?”\n“Not very much.”\n\n100 THE GREAT GATSBY\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued\nmore confidently.\n“T thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you\nsee, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of\nside line, you understand. And I thought that if\nyou don’t make very much— You’re selling bonds,\naren’t you, old sport?”\ncc Trying to.”\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take\nup much of your time and you might pick up a nice\nbit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential\nsort of thing.”\nI realize now that under different circumstances\nthat conversation might have been one of the crises\nof my life. But, because the offer was obviously\nand tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no\nchoice except to cut him off there.\n“Tve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much\nobliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with\nWolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shy-\ning away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at\nlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited\na moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation,\nbut I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy;\nI think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my\nfront door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY IOI\nwent to Coney Island, or for how many hours he\n“glanced into rooms”’ while his house blazed gaudily\non. I called up Daisy from the office next morning,\nand invited her to come to tea.\n“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.\n“What?”\n“Don’t bring Tom.”\n“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven\no’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower,\ntapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby\nhad sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded\nme that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come\nback, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for\nher among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock\na greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumer-\nable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the\nfront door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a\nwhite flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie,\nhurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs\nof sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n“Ts everything all right?” he asked immediately.\n“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”\n“What grass?”’ he inquired blankly. ‘Oh, the\ngrass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it,\nbut, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he\nsaw a thing.\n\n102 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. ‘‘One\nof the papers said they thought the rain would stop\nabout four. 1 think it was The Journal. Have you\ngot everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a\nlittle reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scru-\ntinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n“Will they do?” I asked.\n“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he\nadded hollowly, ‘‘. . . old sport.”\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp\nmist, through which occasional thin drops swam like\ndew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a\ncopy of Clay’s “Economics,” starting at the Fin-\nnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering\ntoward the bleared windows from time to time as\nif a series of invisible but alarming happenings\nwere taking place outside. Finally he got up and\ninformed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was\ngoing home.\n“Why’s that?”\n“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He\nlooked at his watch as if there was some pressing\ndemand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all\nday.”\n“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”\nHe sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him,\nand simultaneously there was the sound of a motor\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 103\nturning into my lane. We both jumped up, and, a\nlittle harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\nUnder the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open\ncar was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s\nface, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lav-\nender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n“Ts this absolutely where you live, my dearest\none?”\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild\ntonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it\nfor a moment, up and down, with my ear alone,\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of\nhair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek,\nand her hand was wet with glistening drops as I\ntook it to help her from the car.\n“‘Are you in love with me,” she said low in my\near, ‘“‘or why did I have to come alone?”\n“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your\nchauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”\n‘Come back in an hour, Ferdie.”” Then in a grave\nmurmur: “His name is Ferdie.”\n““Does the gasoline affect his nose?”\n“T don’t think so,” she said innocently. ‘‘Why?”\nWe went in. To my overwhelming surprise the\nliving-room was deserted.\n“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.\n“What’s funny?”\nShe turned her head as there was a light dignified\n\n104 THE GREAT GATSBY\nknocking at the front door. I went out and opened\nit. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged\nlike weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a\npuddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.\nWith his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked\nby me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on\na wire, and disappeared into the living-room. It\nwasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of\nmy own heart I pulled the door to against the in-\ncreasing rain.\nFor half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then\nfrom the living-room I heard a sort of choking mur-\nmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice\non a clear artificial note:\n“T certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to\ndo in the hall, so I went into the room.\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclin-\ning against the mantelpiece in a strained counter-\nfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head\nleaned back so far that it rested against the face of\na defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position\nhis distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was\nsitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a\nstiff chair.\n““We’ve met before,”’ muttered Gatsby. His eyes\nglanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with\nan abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock\ntook this moment to tilt dangerously at the pres-\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 105\nsure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught\nit with trembling fingers, and set it back in place.\nThen he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of\nthe sofa and his chin in his hand.\n“T’m sorry about the clock,” he said.\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical\nburn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace\nout of the thousand in my head.\n“Tt’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had\nsmashed in pieces on the floor.\n“We haven’t met for many years,” , said Daisy,\nher voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\n“Five years next November.”\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us\nall back at least another minute. I had them both\non their feet with the desperate suggestion that they\nhelp me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac\nFinn brought it in on a tray.\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a\ncertain physical decency established itself. Gatsby\ngot himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I\ntalked, looked conscientiously from one to the other\nof us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calm-\nness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the\nfirst possible moment, and got to my feet.\n‘““Where are you going?”? demanded Gatsby in\nimmediate alarm.\n“Tl be back.”\n\n106 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T’ve got to speak to you about something be-\nfore you go.”\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed\nthe door, and whispered: ““Oh, God!” in a miser-\nable way.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his\nhead from side to side, “‘a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n““You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily\nI added: ‘‘Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\n“‘She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n“Just as much as you are.”\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n“You’re acting like a little boy,”’ I broke out im-\npatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s\nsitting in there all alone.”\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at\nme with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the\ndoor cautiously, went back into the other room.\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had\nwhen he had made his nervous circuit of the house\nhalf an hour before—and ran for a huge black\nknotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric\nagainst the rain. Once more it was pouring, and\nmy irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gar-\ndener, abounded in small muddy swamps and pre-\nhistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at\nfrom under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house,\nso I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 107\nhalf an hour. A brewer had built it early in the\n“period” craze, a decade before, and there was a\nstory that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all\nthe neighboring cottages if the owners would have\ntheir roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their re-\nfusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a\nFamily—he went into an immediate decline. His\nchildren sold his house with the black wreath still\non the door. Americans, while willing, even eager,\nto be serfs, have always been obstinate about being\npeasantry.\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the\ngrocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with\nthe raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure\nhe wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began open-\ning the upper windows of his house, appeared mo-\nmentarily in each, and, leaning from the large cen-\ntral bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was\ntime I went back. While the rain continued it had\nseemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and\nswelling a little now and then with gusts of emo-\ntion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had\nfallen within the house too.\nI went in—after making every possible noise in\nthe kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I\ndon’t believe they heard a sound. They were sitting\nat either end of the couch, looking at each other as\nif some question had been asked, or was in the air,\nand every vestige of embarrassment was gone.\n\n108 THE GREAT GATSBY\nDaisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I\ncame in she jumped up and began wiping at it with\nher handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a\nchange in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He\nliterally glowed; without a word or a gesture of ex-\nultation a new well-being radiated from him and\nfilled the little room.\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t\nseen me for years. I thought for a moment he was\ngoing to shake hands.\n“Tt’s stopped raining.”\n““Has it?’? When he realized what I was talking\nabout, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in\nthe room, he smiled like a weather man, like an\necstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the\nnews to Daisy. “‘What do you think of that? It’s\nstopped raining.”\n“T’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, griev-\ning beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\n“T want you and Daisy to come over to my\nhouse,”’ he said, ‘‘I’d like to show her around.”\n““You’re sure you want me to come?”\n“Absolutely, old sport.”\nDaisy went up-stairs to wash her face—too late\nI thought with humiliation of my towels—while\nGatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n“My house looks well, doesn’t it?”’ he demanded.\n“See how the whole front of it catches the light.”\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY IoQ\n“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door\nand square tower. “It took me just three years to\nearn the money that bought it.”\n“T thought you inherited your money.”\n“T did, old sport,” he said automatically, ‘but\nI lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the\nwar.”\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for\nwhen I asked him what business he was in he an-\nswered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that\nit wasn’t an appropriate reply.\n“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected\nhimself. ‘‘I was in the drug business and then I was\nin the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.”\nHe looked at me with more attention. ‘““Do you\nmean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed\nthe other night?”\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the\nhouse and two rows of brass buttons on her dress\ngleamed in the sunlight.\n“That huge place there?’ she cried pointing.\n“Do you like it?”\n“T love it, but I don’t see how you live there all\nalone.”\n“T keep it always full of interesting people, night\nand day. People who do interesting things. Cele-\nbrated people.”\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound\nwe went down to the road and entered by the big\n\n110 THE GREAT GATSBY\npostern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired\nthis aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against\nthe sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of\njonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum\nblossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-\ngate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and\nfind no stir of bright dresses in and out the door,\nand hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie An-\ntoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt\nthat there were guests concealed behind every\ncouch and table, under orders to be breathlessly\nsilent until we had passed through. As Gatsby\nclosed the door of “the Merton College Library” I\ncould have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break\ninto ghostly laughter.\nWe went up-stairs, through period bedrooms\nswathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with\nnew flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into\none chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas\nwas doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr.\nKlipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wan-\ndering hungrily about the beach that morning.\nFinally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bed-\nroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we\nsat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he\ntook from a cupboard in the wall.\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY III\nthink he revalued everything in his house according\nto the measure of response it drew from her well-\nloved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual\nand astounding presence none of it was any longer\nreal. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of\nstairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except\nwhere the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of\npure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight,\nand smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down\nand shaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n‘It’s the funniest thing, old sport,”’ he said hilari-\nously. “I can’t— When I try to——”\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was\nentering upon a third. After his embarrassment and\nhis unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder\nat her presence. He had been full of the idea so\nlong, dreamed it right through to the end, waited\nwith his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable\npitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was\nrunning down like an overwound clock.\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us\ntwo hulking patent cabinets which held his massed\nsuits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts,\npiled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\n“‘T’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes.\nHe sends over a selection of things at the beginning\nof each season, spring and fall.”\n\n112 THE GREAT GATSBY\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing\nthem, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen\nand thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds\nas they fell and covered the table in many colored\ndisarray. While we admired he brought more and\nthe soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with\nstripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-\ngreen and lavender and faint orange, with mono-\ngrams of Indian blue. Suddenly, with a strained\nsound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began\nto cry stormily.\n“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her\nvoice muffled in the thick folds. ‘It makes me sad\nbecause I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts\nbefore.”\nAfter the house, we were to see the grounds and\nthe swimming-pool, and the hydroplane and the mid-\nsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it\nbegan to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at\nthe corrugated surface of the Sound.\n“Tf it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home\nacross the bay,” said Gatsby. ‘You always have a\ngreen light that burns all night at the end of your\ndock.”\nDaisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he\nseemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly\nit had occurred to him that the colossal significance\nof that light had now vanished forever. Compared\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 113\nto the great distance that had separated him from\nDaisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touch-\ning her. It had seemed as close as a star to the\nmoon. Now it was again a green light on a dock.\nHis count of enchanted objects had diminished by\none.\nI began to walk about the room, examining vari-\nous indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large\nphotograph of an elderly man in yachting costume\nattracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.\n“’Who’s this?”\n“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”\nThe name sounded faintly familiar.\n“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend\nyears ago.”\nThere was a small picture of Gatsby, also in\nyachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his\nhead thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when\nhe was about eighteen.\n“T adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “‘The pompadour!\nYou never told me you had a pompadour—or a\nyacht.”\n“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. ‘‘Here’s a\nlot of clippings—about you.”\nThey stood side by side examining it. I was going\nto ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and\nGatsby took up the receiver.\n— “Ves... . Well, I can’t talk now. ... 1 can’t\ntalk now, old sport. . . . I said a small town. .\n\nII4 THE GREAT GATSBY\nHe must know what a small town is. . . . Well, he’s\nno use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town... .”\nHe rang off.\n“Come here quick!’ cried Daisy at the window.\nThe rain was still falling, but the darkness had\nparted in the west, and there was a pink and golden\nbillow of foamy clouds above the sea.\n“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a\nmoment: ‘‘I’d like to just get one of those pink\nclouds and put you in it and push you around.”\nI tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it;\nperhaps my presence made them feel more satisfac-\ntorily alone.\n“T know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, ‘‘we’ll have\nKlipspringer play the piano.”\nHe went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and\nreturned in a few minutes accompanied by an em-\nbarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-\nrimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now\ndecently clothed in a “sport shirt,”’ open at the neck,\nsneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.\n“Did we interrupt your exercises?” inquired\nDaisy politely.\n“T was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a\nspasm of embarrassment. ‘‘That is, I’d been asleep.\nThen I got up...”\n“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cut-\nting him off. “Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?”\n“T don’t play well. I don’t—I hardly play at all.\nI’m all out of prac——”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY II5\n“We'll go down-stairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He\nflipped a switch. The gray windows disappeared as\nthe house glowed full of light.\nIn the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary\nlamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from\na trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch\nfar across the room, where there was no light save\nwhat the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.\nWhen Klipspringer had played ‘‘The Love Nest”\nhe turned around on the bench and searched un-\nhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.\n“T’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I\ncouldn’t play. I’m all out of prac——”\n“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded\nGatsby. “Play!”\n“Tn the morning,\nIn the evening,\nAin’t we got fun——”\nOutside the wind was loud and there was a faint\nflow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were\ngoing on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-\ncarrying, were plunging home through the rain\nfrom New York. It was the hour of a profound\nhuman change, and excitement was generating on\nthe air.\n“One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer\nThe rich get richer and the poor get—children.\nIn the meantime,\nIn between time——”\n\nI16 THE GREAT GATSBY\nAs I went over to say good-by I saw that the ex-\npression of bewilderment had come back into Gats-\nby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to\nhim as to the quality of his present happiness.\nAlmost five years! There must have been moments\neven that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of\nhis dreams—not through her own fault, but because\nof the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone\nbeyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown\nhimself into it with a creative passion, adding to it\nall the time, decking it out with every bright feather\nthat drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness\ncan challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly\nheart.\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little,\nvisibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said\nsomething low in his ear he turned toward her with\na rush of emotion. I think that voice held him\nmost, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because\nit couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a death-\nless song.\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up\nand held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now\nat all. I looked once more at them and they looked\nback at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.\nThen I went out of the room and down the marble\nsteps into the rain, leaving them there together.\n\nCHAPTER VI\nABOUT this time an ambitious young reporter from\nNew York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and\nasked him if he had anything to say.\n“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby\npolitely.\n“‘Why—any statement to give out.”\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that\nthe man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office\nin a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or\ndidn’t fully understand. This was his day off and\nwith laudable initiative he had hurried out “‘to see.”\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s in-\nstinct was right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about\nby the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality\nand so become authorities upon his past, had in-\ncreased all summer until he fell just short of being\nnews. Contemporary legends such as the “‘under-\nground pipe-line to Canada” attached themselves to\nhim, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked\nlike a house and was moved secretly up and down\nthe Long Island shore. Just why these inventions\nwere a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn’t easy to say.\n117\n\n118 THE GREAT GATSBY\nJames Gatz—that was really, or at least legally,\nhis name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen\nand at the specific moment that witnessed the begin-\nning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht\ndrop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake\nSuperior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing\nalong the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey\nand a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay\nGatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the\nTuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might\ncatch him and break him up in half an hour.\nI suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time,\neven then. His parents were shiftless and unsuc-\ncessful farm people—his imagination had never really\naccepted them as his parents at all. The truth was\nthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang\nfrom his Platonic conception of himself. He was a\nson of God—a phrase which, if it means anything,\nmeans just that—and he must be about His Fa-\nther’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and\nmeretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort\nof Jay Gatsby that a seventeen year-old boy would\nbe likely to invent, and to this conception he was\nfaithful to the end.\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along\nthe south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger\nand a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that\nbrought him food and bed. His brown, hardening\nbody lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 119g\nlazy work of the bracing days. He knew women\nearly, and since they spoiled him he became contemp-\ntuous of them, of young virgins because they were\nignorant, of the others because they were hysterical\nabout things which in his overwhelming self-absorb-\ntion he took for granted.\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.\nThe most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted\nhim in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudi-\nness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked\non the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night\nhe added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsi-\nness closed down upon some vivid scene with an\noblivious embrace. For a while these reveries pro-\nvided an outlet for his imagination; they were a\nsatisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise\nthat the rock of the world was founded securely on\na fairy’s wing.\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him,\nsome months before, to the small Lutheran College\nof St. Olaf’s in northern Minnesota. He stayed there\ntwo weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to\nthe drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and de-\nspising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay\nhis way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to\ndo on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor\nin the shallows alongshore.\n\n120 THE GREAT GATSBY\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the\nNevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for\nmetal since seventy-five. The transactions in Mon-\ntana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-\nmindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number\nof women tried to separate him from his money.\nThe none too savory ramifications by which Ella\nKaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de\nMaintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in\na yacht, were common property of the turgid jour-\nnalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too\nhospitable shores for five years when he turned up\nas James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.\nTo young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking\nup at the railed deck, that yacht represented all\nthe beauty and glamour in the world. 1 suppose he\nsmiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that\npeople liked him when he smiled. At any rate\nCody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited\nthe brand new name) and found that he was quick\nand extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he\ntook him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six\npair of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.\nAnd when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and\nthe Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity—\nwhile he remained with Cody he was in turn steward,\nmate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 121\nCody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody\ndrunk might soon be about, and he provided for such\ncontingencies by reposing more and more trust in\nGatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during\nwhich the boat went three times around the Con-\ntinent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for\nthe fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in\nBoston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably\ndied.\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s\nbedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face\n—the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of\nAmerican life brought back to the Eastern seaboard\nthe savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.\nIt was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so\nlittle. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women\nused to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he\nformed the habit of letting liquor alone.\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money—\na legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t\nget it. He never understood the legal device that\nwas used against him, but what remained of the\nmillions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with\nhis singularly appropriate education; the vague con-\ntour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality\nof a man.\nHe told me all this very much later, but I’ve put\nit down here with the idea of exploding those first\n\n122 THE GREAT GATSBY\nwild rumors about his antecedents, which weren’t\neven faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a\ntime of confusion, when I had reached the point of\nbelieving everything and nothing about him. So I\ntake advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so\nto speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of mis-\nconceptions away.\nIt was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.\nFor several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice\non the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting\naround with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself\nwith her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his\nhouse one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there\ntwo minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan\nin for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the\nreally surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened\nbefore.\nThey were a party of three on horseback—Tom\nand a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a\nbrown riding-habit, who had been there previously.\n“T’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing\non his porch. ‘I’m delighted that you dropped in.”\nAs though they cared!\n“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.”\nHe walked around the room quickly, ringing bells.\n“T’ll have something to drink for you in just a\nminute.”\nHe was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom\nwas there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 123\nhad given them something, realizing in a vague way\nthat that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted\nnothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little cham-\npagne? Nothing at all, thanks. . . . ’m sorry——\n“Did you have a nice ride?”\n“Very good roads around here.”\n“I suppose the automobiles—— ”\n“Yeah.”\nMoved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned\nto Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a\nstranger.\n“T believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr.\nBuchanan.”\n“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously\nnot remembering. “So we did. I remember very\nwell.”\n‘About two weeks ago.”\n“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”\n“T know your wife,’ continued Gatsby, almost\naggressively.\n“That so?”\nTom turned to me.\n“You live near here, Nick?”\n“Next door.”\n“That so?”\nMr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation,\nbut lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman\nsaid nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two\nhighballs, she became cordial.\n\n124 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“We'll all come over to your next party, Mr.\nGatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”\n“Certainly; ?'d be delighted to have you.”\n“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude.\n““Well—think ought to be starting home.”\n“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had\ncontrol of himself now, and he wanted to see more of\nTom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for\nsupper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people\ndropped in from New York.”\n“You come to supper with me,” said the lady\nenthusiastically. “Both of you.”\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n“‘T mean it,” she insisted. “Id love to have you.\nLots of room.”\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted\nto go, and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had deter-\nmined he shouldn’t.\n“T’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on\nGatsby.\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\n““We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted\naloud.\n“T haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. ‘“‘I used to\nride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse.\nI'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for\njust a minute.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 125\nThe rest of us walked out on the porch, where\nSloane and the lady began an impassioned conver-\nsation aside.\n““My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom.\n“‘Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”\n“She says she does want him.”\n“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know\na soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the\ndevil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned\nin my ideas, but women run around too much these\ndays to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\nSuddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down\nthe steps and mounted their horses.\n“Come on,”’ said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we're late.\nWe’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we\ncouldn’t wait, will you?”\nTom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged\na cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive,\ndisappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby,\nwith hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the\nfront door.\nTom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running\naround alone, for on the following Saturday night he\ncame with her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his pres-\nence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppres-\nsiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s\nother parties that summer. There were the same\npeople, or at least the same sort of people, the same\nprofusion of champagne, the same many-colored,\n\n126 THE GREAT GATSBY\nmany-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasant-\nness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t\nbeen there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown\nused to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world com-\nplete in itself, with its own standards and its own\ngreat figures, second to nothing because it had no\nconsciousness of being so, and now I was looking at\nit again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably sad-\ndening to look through new eyes at things upon which\nyou have expended your own powers of adjustment.\nThey arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out\namong the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was\nplaying murmurous tricks in her throat.\n“These things excite me so,’ she whispered. “If\nyou want to kiss me any time during the evening,\nNick, just let me know and Ill be glad to arrange it\nfor you. Just mention my name. Or present a green\ncard. I’m giving out green——”\n“Look around,” suggested Gatsby\n“T’m looking around. I’m having a marvel-\nlous——”’\n“You must see the faces of many people you’ve\nheard about.”\nTom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in\nfact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”\n“Perhaps you know that lady,’”’ Gatsby indicated\na gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who\nsat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom and Daisy\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 127\nstared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accom-\npanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity\nof the movies.\n**She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n“The man bending over her is her director.”\nHe took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n“Mrs. Buchanan...and Mr. Buchanan—”\nAfter an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo\nplayer.”\n“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\nBut evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for\nTom remained “the polo player” for the rest of the\nevening.\n“T’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy ex-\nclaimed, “I liked that man—what was his name ?—\nwith the sort of blue nose.”\nGatsby identified him, adding that he was a small\nproducer.\n“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n“T’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said\nTom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous\npeople in—in oblivion.”\nDaisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being\nsurprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot—I\nhad never seen him dance before. Then they saun-\ntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half\nan hour, while at her request I remained watchfully\nin the garden. ‘In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she\nexplained, ‘‘or any act of God.”\n\n128 THE GREAT GATSBY\nTom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting\ndown to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat\nwith some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s\ngetting off some funny stuff.”\n“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you\nwant to take down any addresses here’s my little\ngold pencil.” . . . She looked around after a moment\nand told me the girl was ‘‘common but pretty,”\nand I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been\nalone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.\nWe were at a particularly tipsy table. That was\nmy fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and\nI'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before.\nBut what had amused me then turned septic on the\nair now.\n“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”’\nThe girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to\nslump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat\nup and opened her eyes.\n6cW ha’ ? 99\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been\nurging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club\nto-morrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or\nsix cocktails she always starts screaming like that.\nT tell her she ought to leave it alone.”\n“T do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hol-\nlowly.\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY I29\nhere: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help,\nDoc.’”\n“‘She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another\nfriend, without gratitude, “but you ’got her dress\nall wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a\npool,”” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost\ndrowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered\nDoctor Civet.\n“Speak for yourself!” ihe a cried Miss Baedeker vio-\nlently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you\noperate on me!”\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember\nwas standing with Daisy and watching the moving-\npicture director and his Star. They were still under\nthe white-plum tree and their faces were touching\nexcept for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.\nIt occurred to me that he had been very slowly bend-\ning toward her all evening to attain this proximity,\nand even while I watched I saw him stoop one ulti-\nmate degree and kiss at her cheek.\n“‘T like her,” said Daisy, ‘“‘I think she’s lovely.”\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably, be-\ncause it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was\nappalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “‘place”’\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island\nfishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed\nunder the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive\n\n130 THE GREAT GATSBY\nfate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut\nfrom nothing to nothing. She saw something awful\nin the very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they\nwaited for their car. It was dark here in front; only\nthe bright door sent ten square feet of light volley-\ning out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a\nshadow moved against a dressing-room blind above,\ngave way to another shadow, an indefinite proces-\nsion of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom\nsuddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”\n““Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n“‘T didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these\nnewly rich people are just big bootleggers, you\nknow.”\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the\ndrive crunched under his feet.\n“‘Well, he certainly must have strained himself to\nget this menagerie together.”\nA breeze stirred the gray haze of Daisy’s fur col-\nlar.\n“At least they are more interesting than the\npeople we know,” she said with an effort.\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n“Well, I was.”\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 131\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked\nher to put her under a cold shower?”\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky,\nrythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each\nword that it had never had before and would never\nhave again. When the melody rose her voice broke\nup sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices\nhave, and each change tipped out a little of her warm\nhuman magic upon the air.\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,”\nshe said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited.\nThey simply force their way in and he’s too polite\nto object.”\n“‘T’d like to know who he is and what he does,”\ninsisted Tom. “And I think I'll make a point of find-\ning out.”\n“T can tell you right now,” she answered. “He\nowned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores. He\nbuilt them up himself.”\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of\nthe steps, where ‘‘Three o’Clock in the Morning,”\na neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out\nthe open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities\ntotally absent from her world. What was it up there\nin the song that seemed to be calling her back inside?\nWhat would happen now in the dim, incalculable\n\n132 THE GREAT GATSBY\nhours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would\narrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled\nat, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical\nencounter, would blot out those five years of un-\nwavering devotion.\nI stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait\nuntil he was free, and I lingered in the garden until\nthe inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled\nand exalted, from the black beach, until the lights\nwere extinguished in the guest-rooms overhead.\nWhen he came down the steps at last the tanned skin\nwas drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n“Of course she did.”\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “‘She didn’t have\na good time.”\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable\ndepression.\n“T feel far away from her,” he said. ‘It’s hard to\nmake her understand.”\n“You mean about the dance?”\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had\ngiven with a snap of his fingers. ‘‘Old sport, the dance\nis unimportant.”\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she\nshould go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.”\nAfter she had obliterated four years with that sen-\ntence they could decide upon the more practical\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 133\nmeasures to be taken. One of them was that, after\nshe was free, they were to go back to Louisville and\nbe married from her house—just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. ‘‘She used\nto be able to understand. We'd sit for hours——”’\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a\ndesolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and\ncrushed flowers.\n“T wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured.\n“You can’t repeat the past.”\n“‘Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously.\n“Why of course you can!”\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were\nlurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of\nreach of his hand.\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was\nbefore,” he said, nodding determinedly. ‘‘She’ll see.”\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that\nhe wanted to recover something, some idea of him-\nself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His\nlife had been confused and disordered since then,\nbut if he could once return to a certain starting\nplace and go over it all slowly, he could find out\nwhat that thing was... .\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they\nhad been walking down the street when the leaves\nwere falling, and they came to a place where there\nwere no trees and the sidewalk was white with moon-\nlight. They stopped here and turned toward each\n\n134 THE GREAT GATSBY\nother. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious\nexcitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were hum-\nming out into the darkness and there was a stir and\nbustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye\nGatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above\nthe trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone,\nand once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp\ndown the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white\nface came up to his own. He knew that when he\nkissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable vi-\nsions to her perishable breath, his mind would never\nromp again like the mind of God. So he waited,\nlistening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork\nthat had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like\na flower and the incarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling\nsentimentality, I was reminded of something—an\nelusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had\nheard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a\nphrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips\nparted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more\nstruggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.\nBut they made no sound, and what I had almost\nremembered was uncommunicable forever.\n\nCHAPTER VII\nIr was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its\nhighest that the lights in his house failed to go on one\nSaturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun,\nhis career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually\ndid I become aware that the automobiles which\nturned expectantly into his drive stayed for just\na minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering\nif he were sick I went over to find out—an unfa-\nmiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me\nsuspiciously from the door.\n“Ts Mr. Gatsby sick?”\n‘“‘Nope.” After a pause he added “‘sir’’ in a dila-\ntory, grudging way.\n*“‘T hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather wor-\nried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n“Carraway.”\n“Carraway. All right, PU tell him.”\nAbruptly he slammed the door.\nMy Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed\nevery servant in his house a week ago and replaced\nthem with half a dozen others, who never went into\nWest Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen,\nbut ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.\nThe grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked\n135\n\n136 THE GREAT GATSBY\nlike a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village\nwas that the new people weren’t servants at all.\nNext day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n“Going away?” I inquired.\n“No, old sport.”\n“T hear you fired all your servants.”\n“T wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy\ncomes over quite often—in the afternoons.”\nSo the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card\nhouse at the disapproval in her eyes.\n“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do\nsomething for. They’re all brothers and sisters.\nThey used to run a small hotel.”\n“T see.”\nHe was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I\ncome to lunch at her house to-morrow? Miss Baker\nwould be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself\ntelephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was\ncoming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t be-\nlieve that they would choose this occasion for a\nscene—especially for the rather harrowing scene\nthat Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\nThe next day was broiling, almost the last, cer-\ntainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train\nemerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot\nwhistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the\nsimmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car\nhovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next\nto me perspired delicately for a while into her white\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 137\nshirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened\nunder her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat\nwith a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the\nfloor.\n“Oh, my!” she gasped.\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it\nback to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the\nextreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no\ndesigns upon it—but every one near by, including\nthe woman, suspected me just the same.\n“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces.\n“Some weather!... Hot!... Hot!... Hot!...\nIs it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Isit...?”\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a\ndark stain from his hand. That any one should care\nin this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head\nmade damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n. . . Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house\nblew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the tele-\nphone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at\nthe door.\n“The master’s body!” roared the butler into the\nmouthpiece. “I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t\nfurnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this noon!”\nWhat he really said was: “Yes... Yes... Ill\nsee.”\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us,\nglistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.\n““Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried,\n\n138 THE GREAT GATSBY\nneedlessly indicating the direction. In this heat\nevery extra gesture was an affront to the common\nstore of life.\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark\nand cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous\ncouch, like silver idols weighing down their own\nwhite dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n“We can’t move,” they said together.\nJordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan,\nrested for a moment in mine.\n““And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I\ninquired.\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled,\nhusky, at the hall telephone.\nGatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet\nand gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy\nwatched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh;\na tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the\nair.\n“The rumor is,”’ whispered Jordan, “‘that that’s\nTom’s girl on the telephone.”\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high\nwith annoyance: ‘Very well, then, I won’t sell you\nthe car at all.... I’m under no obligations to you\nat all... and as for your bothering me about it at\nlunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”\n“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.\n‘No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide\ndeal. I happen to know about it.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 139\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space\nfor a moment with his thick body, and hurried into\nthe room.\n“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand\nwith well-concealed dislike. ‘‘I’m glad to see you,\nSita ay DCs ce a\n‘Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over\nto Gatsby and pulled his face down, kissing him on\nthe mouth.\n“You know I love you,” she murmured.\n“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\n“You kiss Nick too.”\n“What a low, vulgar girl!”\n“T don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog\non the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the\nheat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a\nfreshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came\ninto the room.\n“Bles-sed pre-cious,’’ she crooned, holding out\nher arms. “Come to your own mother that loves\nyou.”\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across\nthe room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.\n“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get pow-\nder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and\nsay—How-de-do.”’\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the\n\n140 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsmall reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking\nat the child with surprise. I don’t think he had ever\nreally believed in its existence before.\n“‘T got dressed before luncheon,” said the child,\nturning eagerly to Daisy.\n““That’s because your mother wanted to show\nyou off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of\nthe small white neck. ““You dream, you. You ab-\nsolute little dream.”\n“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jor-\ndan’s got on a white dress too.”\n“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy\nturned her around so that she faced Gatsby. ‘Do\nyou think they’re pretty?”\n“Where’s Daddy?”\n“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained\nDaisy. “She looks like me. She’s got my hair and\nshape of the face.”\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took\na step forward and held out her hand.\n“Come, Pammy.”\n““Good-by, sweetheart !”\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disci-\nplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled\nout the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four\ngin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\nGatsby took up his drink.\n“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible\ntension.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 141\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\n“‘T read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter\nevery year,’ said Tom genially. “It seems that\npretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—\nor wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s\ngetting colder every year.\n“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d\nlike you to have a look at the place.”\nI went with them out to the veranda. On the\ngreen Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail\ncrawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby’s\neyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and\npointed across the bay.\n“T’m right across from you.” —\n“So you are.”\nOur eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot\nlawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days along-\nshore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved\nagainst the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay\nthe scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding.\n“Td like to be out there with him for about an\nhour.”\nWe had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened\ntoo against the heat, and drank down nervous\ngayety with the cold ale.\n“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?”\ncried Daisy, “‘and the day after that, and the next\nthirty years?”\n\n142 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. ‘Life starts all\nover again when it gets crisp in the fall.”\n“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of\ntears, “‘and everything’s so confused. Let’s all go\nto town!”\nHer voice struggled on through the heat, beating\nagainst it, molding its senselessness into forms.\n“T’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,”\nTom was saying to Gatsby, ‘“‘but I’m the first man\nwho ever made a stable out of a garage.”\n“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy\ninsistently. Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. “Ah,”\nshe cried, “you look so cool.”\nTheir eyes met, and they stared together at each\nother, alone in space. With an effort she glanced\ndown at the table.\n“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\nShe had told him that she loved him, and\nTom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth\nopened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then\nback at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as\nsome one he knew al ong time ago.\n“You resemble the advertisement of the man,”\nshe went on innocently. “You know the advertise-\nment of the man——”\n“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly\nwilling to go to town.\" Come on—we’re all going to\ntown.”\nHe got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby\nand his wife. No one moved.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 143\n“Come on!” His temper cracked al ittle. “What’s\nthe matter, anyhow? If we’re going to town, let’s\nstart.”\nHis hand, trembling with his effort at self-control,\nbore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s\nvoice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing\ngravel drive.\n“Are we just going to go?” she objected. ‘Like\nthis? Aren’t we going to let any one smoke a\ncigarette first ?””\n“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too\nhot to fuss.”\nHe didn’t answer.\n“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on,\nJordan.”\nThey went up-stairs to get ready while we three\nmen stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our\nfeet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in\nthe western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed\nhis mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him\nexpectantly.\n“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby\nwith an effort.\n“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n*“Oh.”’\nA pause.\n“T don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out\nTom savagely. “‘Women get these notions in their\nheads——”\n\n144 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy\nfrom an upper window.\n“T’ll get some whiskey,”’ answered Tom. He went\ninside.\nGatsby turned to me rigidly:\n“T can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n“‘She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s\nfull of—’’ I hesitated.\n“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\nThat was it. I’d never understood before. It was\nfull of money—that was the inexhaustible charm\nthat rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’\nsong of it. ... High in a white palace the king’s\ndaughter, the golden girl... .\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart\nbottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan\nwearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carry-\ning light capes over their arms.\n“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby.\nHe felt the hot, green leather of the seat. “I ought\nto have left it in the shade.”\n“Ts it standard shift?”? demanded Tom.\n“Ves,”\n“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your\ncar to town.”\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n*T don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.\n“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked\nat the gauge. ‘And if it runs out I can stop at a drug-\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 145\nstore. You can buy anything at a drug-store nowa-\ndays.”\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark.\nDaisy looked at Tom frowning, and an indefinable\nexpression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely\nrecognizable, as if I had only heard it described in\nwords, passed over Gatsby’s face.\n“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with\nhis hand toward Gatsby’s car. “T’ll take you in this\ncircus wagon.”\nHe opened the door, but she moved out from the\ncircle of his arm.\n“You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in\nthe coupé.”\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with\nher hand. Jordan and Tom andI got into the front\nseat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar\ngears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive\nheat, leaving them out of sight behind.\n“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.\n“See what?”\nHe looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and\nI must have known all along.\n“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he\nsuggested. “Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a\nsecond sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\nMaybe you don’t believe that, but science——”\nHe paused. The immediate contingency overtook\nhim, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical\nabyss.\n\n146 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,”\nhe continued. “I could have gone deeper if I’d\nknown——”\n“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” in-\nquired Jordan humorously.\n“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed.\n“A medium?”\n‘About Gatsby.”\n“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been\nmaking a small investigation of his past.”\n“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said\nJordan helpfully.\n“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. ‘Like hell\nhe is! He wears a pink suit.”\n“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”\n“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemp-\ntuously, “or something like that.”\n“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you\ninvite him to lunch?” demanded Jordan crossly.\n“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we\nwere married—God knows where!”\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale, and\naware of it we drove for a while in silence. Then\nas Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into\nsight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution\nabout gasoline.\n“We've got enough to get us to town,’ y said\nTom.\n“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jor-\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 147\ndan. “I don’t want to get stalled in this baking\nheat.”\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we\nslid to an abrupt dusty spot under Wilson’s sign.\nAfter a moment the proprietor emerged from the in-\nterior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at\nthe car.\n“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly.\n“What do you think we stopped for—to admire the\nview ?”\n“T’m sick, ” said Wilson without moving. ‘Been\nsick all day.”\n““What’s the matter?”\n“Tm all run down.”\n“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded.\n“You sounded well enough on the phone.”\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support\nof the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the\ncap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.\n“T didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said.\n“‘But I need money pretty bad, and I was wonder-\ning what you were going to do with your old car.”\n“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I\nbought it last week.”\n“Tt’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained\nat the handle.\n“Like to buy it?”\n“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but\nI could make some money on the other.”\n\n148 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“What do you want money for, all of a sud-\nden?”\n“T’ve been here too long. I want to get away.\nMy wife and I want to go West.”\n“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.\n“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He\nrested for a moment against the pump, shading his\neyes. ‘And now she’s going whether she wants to or\nnot. I’m going to get her away.”\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and\nthe flash of a waving hand.\n“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.\n“T just got wised up to something funny the last\ntwo days,” remarked Wilson. ‘“‘That’s why I want\nto get away. That’s why I been bothering you about\nthe car.”\n“What do I owe you?”\n“Dollar twenty.”\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to con-\nfuse me and I had a bad moment there before I\nrealized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on\nTom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort\nof life apart from him in another world, and the\nshock had made him physically sick. I stared at\nhim and then at Tom, who had made a parallel dis-\ncovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to\nme that there was no difference between men, in\nintelligence or race, so profound as the difference\nbetween the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 149\nthat he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he\nhad just got some poor girl with child.\n“Tl let you have that car,” said Tom. ‘‘T’ll send\nit over to-morrow afternoon.”\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting,\neven in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I\nturned my head as though I had been warned of\nsomething behind. Over the ashheaps the giant\neyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but\nI perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were\nregarding us with peculiar intensity from less than\ntwenty feet away.\nIn one of the windows over the garage the cur-\ntains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle\nWilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed\nwas she that she had no consciousness of being ob-\nserved, and one emotion after another crept into\nher face like objects into a slowly developing pic-\nture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was\nan expression I had often seen on women’s faces,\nbut on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless\nand inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide\nwith jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on\nJordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a sim-\nple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling\nthe hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress,\nuntil an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\n\n150 THE GREAT GATSBY\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him\nstep on the accelerator with the double purpose of\novertaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and\nwe sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we\ncame in sight of the easy-going blue coupé.\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are\ncool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on sum-\nmer afternoons when every one’s away. There’s\nsomething very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all\nsorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your\nhands.”\nThe word “‘sensuous” had the effect of further dis-\nquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest\nthe coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to\ndraw up alongside.\n‘Where are we going?” she cried.\n“How about the movies?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We'll\nride around and meet you after.” With an effort her\nwit rose faintly, ‘‘We’ll meet you on some corner.\nI'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impa-\ntiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind\nus. “You follow me to the south side of Central\nPark, in front of the Plaza.”\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back\nfor their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed\nup until they came into sight. I think he was afraid\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY I51\nthey would dart down as ide street and out of his life\nforever.\nBut they didn’t. And we all took the less explica-\nble step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza\nHotel.\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that\nended by herding us into that room eludes me,\nthough I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp\nsnake around my legs and intermittent beads of\nsweat raced cool across my back. The notion origi-\nnated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bath-\nrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more\ntangible form as ‘‘a place to have a mint julep.”\nEach of us said over and over that it was a “‘crazy\nidea””—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and\nthought, or pretended to think, that we were being\nvery funny...\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it\nwas already four o’clock, opening the windows ad-\nmitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.\nDaisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to\nus, fixing her hair.\n“Tt’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respect-\nfully, and every one laughed.\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy,\nwithout turning around.\n“There aren’t any more.”\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe——”\n\n152 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said\nTom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by\ncrabbing about it.”\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel\nand put it on the table.\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked\nGatsby. “‘You’re the one that wanted to come to\ntown.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone\nbook slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor,\nwhereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but\nthis time no one laughed.\n“Tl pick it up,” I offered.\n“‘’ve got it.”” Gatsby examined the parted string,\nmuttered ‘‘Hum!”’ in an interested way, and tossed\nthe book on a chair.\n““That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said\nTom sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick\nthat up?”\n““Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around\nfrom the mirror, “‘if you’re going to make personal\nremarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and\norder some ice for the mint julep.”\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed\nheat exploded into sound and we were listening\nto the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding\nMarch from the ballroom below.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 153\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat !”” cried\nJordan dismally.\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,”\nDaisy remembered, “Louisville in June! Somebody\nfainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he\nmade boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi,\nTennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” appended\nJordan, “‘because we lived just two doors from the\nchurch. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left\nDaddy died.” After a moment she added. ‘‘There\nwasn’t any connection.”\n“T used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,”\nI remarked.\n“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family\nhistory before he left. He gave me an aluminum\nputter that I use to-day.”\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began\nand now a long cheer floated in at the window,\nfollowed by intermittent cries of ‘‘ Yea—ea—ea!”\nand finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing be-\ngan.\n“We're getting old,” said Daisy. “lf we were\nyoung we'd rise and dance.”\n“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. ‘‘ Where’d\nyou know him, Tom?”\n\n154 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I\ndidn’t know him. He was a friend of Daisy’s.”\n“He was not,” she denied. ‘I’d never seen him\nbefore. He came down in the private car.”\n“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised\nin Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the\nlast minute and asked if we had room for him.”\nJordan smiled.\n“He was probably bumming his way home. He\ntold me he was president of your class at Yale.”\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\n“Bilowi?”\n“First place, we didn’t have any president——”\nGatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and\nTom eyed him suddenly.\n“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an\nOxford man.”\n“Not exactly.”\n“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”\n““Ves—I went there.”\nA pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and in-\nsulting:\n“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi\nwent to New Haven.”\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in\nwith crushed mint and ice but the silence was un-\nbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of\nthe door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared\nup at last.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 155\n“T told you I went there,” said Gatsby.\n“T heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n“Tt was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five\nmonths. That’s why I can’t really call myself an\nOxford man.”\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his un-\nbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.\n“Tt was an opportunity they gave to some of\nthe officers after the armistice,”’ he continued. ‘‘We\ncould go to any of the universities in England or\nFrance.”\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I\nhad one of those renewals of complete faith in him\nthat I’d experienced before.\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n“Open the whiskey, Tom,” she ordered, ‘“‘and Ill\nmake you a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so\nstupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!”\n“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “TI want to ask\nMr. Gatsby one more question.”\n““Go on,” Gatsby said politely.\n“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my\nhouse anyhow?”\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was\ncontent.\n“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately\nfrom one to the other. “You’re causing a row.\nPlease have al ittle self-control.”\n“Self-control!”” repeated Tom incredulously. “I\n\n156 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsuppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr.\nNobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\nWell, if that’s the idea you can count me out... .\nNowadays people begin by sneering at family life\nand family institutions, and next they’ll throw every-\nthing overboard and have intermarriage between\nblack and white.”\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw\nhimself standing alone on the last barrier of civiliza-\ntion.\n“We're all white here,” murmured Jordan.\n“T know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big\nparties. I suppose you’ve got to make your house\ninto a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the\nmodern world.”\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted\nto laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transi-\ntion from libertine to prig was so complete.\n“‘T’ve got something to tell you, old sport—”’ began\nGatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.\n“Please don’t !” she interrupted helplessly. “‘ Please\nlet’s all go home. Why don’t we all go home?”\n“That’s a good idea.” I got up. “Come on, Tom.\nNobody wants a drink.”\n“T want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”\n“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “‘She’s\nnever loved you. She loves me.”\n“Vou must be crazy!” exclaimed iTom_auto-\nmatically.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 157\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n“She never loved you, do you hear?”’ he cried.\n“She only married you because I was poor and she\nwas tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake,\nbut in her heart she never loved any one except\nme!”\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom\nand Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that\nwe remain—as though neither of them had anything\nto conceal and it would be a privilege to partake\nvicariously of their emotions.\n“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuc-\ncessfully for the paternal note. ‘“‘What’s been going\non? I want to hear all about it.”\n“IT told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby.\n“Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.”\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\n“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n“Not seeing,’ said Gatsby. ‘No, we couldn’t\nmeet. But both of us loved each other all that time,\nold sport, and you didn’t know. I used to laugh\nsometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes\n—‘‘to think that you didn’t know.”\n““Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers\ntogether like a clergyman and leaned back in his\nchair.\n“You’re crazy!” he exploded. ‘I can’t speak\nabout what happened five years ago, because I didn’t\nknow Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how\n\n158 THE GREAT GATSBY\nyou got within a mile of her unless you brought the\ngroceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s\na God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married\nme and she loves me now.”\n“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes\nshe gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know\nwhat she’s doing.” He nodded sagely. ‘And what’s\nmore, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on\na spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come\nback, and in my heart I love her all the time.”\n“You're revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me,\nand her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the\nroom with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we\nleft Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat\nyou to the story of that little spree.”\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly.\n“Tt doesn’t matter any more. Just tell him the\ntruth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped\nout forever.”\nShe looked at him blindly. ““Why—how could I\nlove him—possibly ?”\n“You never loved him.”\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with\na sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what\nshe was doing—and as though she had never, all\nalong, intended doing anything at all. But it was\ndone now. It was too late.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 159\n“T never loved him,” she said, with perceptible\nreluctance.\n“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.\nccN o.”\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffo-\ncating chords were drifting up on hot waves of\nair.\n“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch\nBowl to keep your shoes dry?”’ There was a husky\ntenderness in his tone. . . . “Daisy?”\n“Please don’t.”” Her voice was cold, but the ran-\ncor was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. “‘ There,\nJay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a\ncigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the\ncigarette and the burning match on the carpet.\n“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby.\n“T love you now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help\nwhat’s past.” She began to sob helplessly. “I did\nlove him once—but I loved you too.”\nGatsby’s eyes opened and closed.\n“You loved me too?” he repeated.\n“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She\ndidn’t know you were alive. Why—there’re things\nbetween Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things\nthat neither of us can ever forget.”\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n“TI want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted.\n“She’s all excited now——”\n“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,”\n\n160 THE GREAT GATSBY\nshe admitted in a pitiful voice. “It wouldn’t be\ntrue.”\n“‘Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\nShe turned to her husband.\n“As if it mattered to you,” she said.\n“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better\ncare of you from now on.”\n“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a\ntouch of panic. ‘‘ You’re not going to take care of her\nany more.”\n“Y’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and\nlaughed. He could afford to control himself now.\n““Why’s that?”\n“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n‘“Nonsense.””\n“T am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly\nleaned down over Gatsby. “Certainly not for a com-\nmon swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on\nher finger.”\n“JT won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please\nlet’s get out.”\n_ “Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re\none of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer\nWolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve\nmade al ittle investigation into your affairs—and I'll\ncarry it further to-morrow.”\n“You can suit yourself about that, old sport.” said\nGatsby steadily.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 161\n‘“T found out what your ‘drug-stores’ were.” He\nturned to us and spoke rapidly. ‘‘He and this Wolfs-\nhiem bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here\nand in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the\ncounter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked\nhim for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I\nwasn’t far wrong.”\n“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess\nyour friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come\nin on it.”\n“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You\nlet him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey.\nGod! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of\nyou.”\n“‘He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to\npick up some money, old sport.”\n“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom.\nGatsby said nothing. ‘Walter could have you up on\nthe betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into\nshutting his mouth.”\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back\nagain in Gatsby’s face.\n“That drug-store business was just small change,”\ncontinued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something\non now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”\nT glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified be-\ntween Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who\nhad begun to balance an invisible but absorbing\nobject on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\n\n162 THE GREAT GATSBY\nGatsby—and was startled at his expression. He\nlooked—and this is said in all contempt for the bab-\nbled slander of his garden—as if he had ‘“‘killed a\nman.” For a moment the set of his face could be\ndescribed in just that fantastic way.\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy,\ndenying everything, defending his name against\naccusations that had not been made. But with every\nword she was drawing further and further into her-\nself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream\nfought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to\ntouch what was no longer tangible, struggling un-\nhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice\nacross the room.\nThe voice begged again to go.\n“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions,\nwhatever courage she had had, were definitely gone.\n“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In\nMr. Gatsby’s car.”\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted\nwith magnanimous scorn.\n“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes\nthat his presumptuous little flirtation is over.”\nThey were gone, without a word, snapped out,\nmade accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our\npity.\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping\nthe unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.\n“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 163\nI didn’t answer.\n“Nick?” He asked again.\n“What?”\n“Want any?”\n“No ... 1 just remembered that to-day’s my\nbirthday.”\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous,\nmenacing road of a new decade.\nIt was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé\nwith him and started for Long Island. Tom talked\nincessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was\nas remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor\non the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated over-\nhead. Human sympathy has its limits, and we were\ncontent to let all their tragic arguments fade with\nthe city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a\ndecade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to\nknow, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning\nhair. But there was Jordan beside me, who, unlike\nDaisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark\nbridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s\nshoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died\naway with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling\ntwilight.\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee\njoint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness\nat the inquest. He had slept through the heat until\n\n164 THE GREAT GATSBY\nafter five, when he strolled over to the garage, and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office—really sick,\npale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Mich-\naelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused,\nsaying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While\nhis neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent\nracket broke out overhead.\n“T’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained\nWilson calmly. ‘“‘She’s going to stay there till the\nday after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move\naway.”\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neigh-\nbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed\nfaintly capable of such a statement. Generally he\nwas one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t\nworking, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared\nat the people and the cars that passed along the\nroad. When any one spoke to him he invariably\nlaughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his\nwife’s man and not his own.\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had\nhappened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead\nhe began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his\nvisitor and ask him what he’d been doing at cer-\ntain times on certain days. Just as the latter was\ngetting uneasy, some workmen came past the door\nbound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the op-\nportunity to get away, intending to come back later.\nBut he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all.\nWhen he came outside again, a little after seven, he\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 165\nwas reminded of the conversation because he heard\nMrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs\nin the garage.\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. ‘Throw me down\nand beat me, you dirty little coward!”\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk,\nwaving her hands and shouting—before he could\nmove from his door the business was over.\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it,\ndidn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness,\nwavered tragically for a moment, and then disap-\npeared around the next bend. Mavromichaelis\nwasn’t even sure of its color—he told the first police-\nman that it was light green. The other car, the one\ngoing toward New York, came to rest a hundred\nyards beyond, and it’s driver hurried back to where\nMyrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt\nin the road and mingled her thick dark blood with\nthe dust.\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but\nwhen they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp\nwith perspiration, they saw that her left breast was\nswinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to\nlisten for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide\nopen and ripped a little at the corners, as though\nshe had choked al ittle in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the\ncrowd when we were still some distance away\n\n166 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll\nhave a little business at last.”\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention\nof stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed,\nintent faces of the people at the garage door made\nhim automatically put on the brakes.\n“We'll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a\nlook.”\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound\nwhich issued incessantly from the garage, a sound\nwhich as we got out of the coupé and walked toward\nthe door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my\nGod!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n“There’s some bad trouble here,”’ said Tom ex-\ncitedly.\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle\nof heads into the garage, which was lit only by a\nyellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead.\nThen he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with\na violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms\npushed his way through.\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur\nof expostulation; it was a minute before I could see\nanything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the\nline, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly in-\nside.\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and\nthen in another blanket, as though she suffered from\na chill in the hot night, lay on a work-table by the\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 167\nwall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\nover it, motionless. Next to him stood a motor-\ncycle policeman taking down names with much\nsweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words\nthat echoed clamorously through the bare garage—\nthen I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold\nof his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was\ntalking to him in a low voice and attempting, from\ntime to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but\nWilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop\nslowly from the swinging light to the laden table by\nthe wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and\nhe gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh,\nmy Ga-od !”\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and,\nafter staring around the garage with glazed eyes,\naddressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n““M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, ‘“—o——”’\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “‘ M-a-v-r-o——”\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n““r—” said the policeman, ‘‘o——”\nce g ”?\n““g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell\nsharply on his shoulder. ‘‘What you want, fella?”’\n“What happened P—that’s what I want to know.”\n\n168 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n‘She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even\nstopus car.”\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one\ncomin’, one goin’, see?”\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand\nrose toward the blankets but stopped half way and\nfell to his side—‘‘she ran out there an’ the one\ncomin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’\nthirty or forty miles an hour.”\n““What’s the name of this place here?” demanded\nthe officer.\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n“Tt was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car.\nNew.”\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going\nfaster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out\nnow. I want to get his name.”\nSome words of this conversation must have reached\nWilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a\nnew theme found voice among his gasping cries:\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it\nwas! I know what kind of car it was!”\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 169\nhis shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked\nquickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of\nhim seized him, firmly by the upper arms.\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said\nwith soothing gruffness.\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his\ntiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees\nhad not Tom held him upright.\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him al ittle. “TI just\ngot here a minute ago, from New York. I was\nbringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t\nmine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all after-\nnoon.”\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear\nwhat he said, but the policeman caught something\nin the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n“Tm a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but\nkept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. ‘‘He says\nhe knows the car that did it.... It was a yellow\ncar.”\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look\nsuspiciously at Tom.\n“And what color’s your car?”\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n““We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us\nconfirmed this, and the policeman turned away.\n\n170 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“‘Now, if you’ll let me have that name again cor-\nrect——”’\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him\ninto the office, set him down in a chair, and came\nback.\n“Tf somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he\nsnapped authoritatively. He watched while the two\nmen standing closest glanced at each other and went\nunwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door\non them and came down the single step, his eyes\navoiding the table. As he passed close to me he\nwhispered: ‘‘Let’s get out.”\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms break-\ning the way, we pushed through the still gathering\ncrowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who\nhad been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend\n—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé\nraced along through the night. In a little while I\nheard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were\noverflowing down his face.\n“The God damned coward !”’ he whimpered. “He\ndidn’t even stop his car.”\nThe Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us\nthrough the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped be-\nside the porch and looked up at the second floor,\nwhere two windows bloomed with light among the\nvines.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 171\n“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the\ncar he glanced at me and frowned slightly.\n“T ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick.\nThere’s nothing we can do to-night.”\nA change had come over him, and he spoke\ngravely, and with decision. As we walked across\nthe moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the\nsituation in a few brisk phrases.\n“T’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and\nwhile you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in\nthe kitchen and have them get you some supper—\nif you want any.” He opened the door. ‘Come\nin.”\n“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me\nthe taxi. I’ll wait outside.”\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\n“Won't you come in, Nick?”\n“No, thanks.”\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone.\nBut Jordan lingered for a moment more.\n“Tt’s only half-past nine,” she said.\nI'd be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all\nof them for one day, and suddenly that included\nJordan too. She must have seen something of this\nin my expression, for she turned abruptly away and\nran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down\nfor a few minutes with my head in my hands, until\nI heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the\n\n172 THE GREAT GATSBY\ndrive away from the house, intending to wait by the\ngate.\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my\nname and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes\ninto the path. I must have felt pretty weird by\nthat time, because I could think of nothing except\nthe luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.\nFor all I knew he was going to rob the house in a\nmoment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinis-\nter faces, the faces of “‘Wolfshiem’s people,” behind\nhim in the dark shrubbery.\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked\nafter a minute.\ncc Yes.”’\nHe hesitated.\n“Was she killed?”\nccYc es.”\n“T thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s\nbetter that the shock should all come at once. She\nstood it pretty well.”\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing\nthat mattered.\n“T got to West Egg bya side road,” he went on,\n“‘and left the car in my garage. I don’t think any-\nbody saw us, but of course I can’t be sure.”\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t\nfind it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 173\n‘Who was the woman?” he inquired.\n“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the\ngarage. How the devil did it happen?”\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—”’ He broke\noff, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n“Was Daisy driving?”\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course\nI'll say I was. You see, when we left New York she\nwas very nervous and she thought it would steady\nher to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just\nas we were passing a car coming the other way. It\nall happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that\nshe wanted to speak to us, thought we were some-\nbody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from\nthe woman toward the other car, and then she lost\nher nerve and turned back. The second my hand\nreached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have\nkilled her instantly.”\n“Tt ripped her open——”\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.”’ He winced. “Any-\nhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop,\nbut she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake.\nThen she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n“She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently.\n“T’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to\nbother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.\nShe’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any\nbrutality she’s going to turn the light out and on\nagain.”\n\n174 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“He won’t touch her,” I said. ‘‘He’s not thinking\nabout her.”\n“T don’t trust him, old sport.”\n“How long are you going to wait?”\n“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go\nto bed.”\nA new point of view occurred tome. Suppose Tom\nfound out that Daisy had been driving. He might\nthink he saw a connection in it—he might think any-\nthing. I looked at the house; there were two or three\nbright windows down-stairs and the pink glow from\nDaisy’s room on the second floor.\n“You wait here,” I said. ‘‘I’ll see if there’s any\nsign of a commotion.”\nI walked back along the border of the Jawn, tra-\nversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda\nsteps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I\nsaw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch\nwhere we had dined that June night three months\nbefore, I came to a small rectangle of light which I\nguessed was the pantry window. The blind was\ndrawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other\nat the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried\nchicken between them, and two bottles of ale. He\nwas talking intently across the table at her, and in\nhis earnestness his hand had fallen upon and cov-\nered her own. Once in a while she looked up at\nhim and nodded in agreement.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 175\nThey weren’t happy, and neither of them had\ntouched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t\nunhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of\nnatural intimacy about the picture, and anybody\nwould have said that they were conspiring together.\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feel-\ning its way along the dark road toward the house.\nGatsby was waiting where I had left him in the\ndrive.\n“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.\n“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You'd better\ncome home and get some sleep.”\nHe shook his head.\n“T want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good\nnight, old sport.”\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned\nback eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though\nmy presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So\nI walked away and left him standing there in the\nmoonlight—watching over nothing.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\nI coutpn’r sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning\nincessantly on the Sound, and I tossed _half-sick\nbetween grotesque reality and savage, frightening\ndreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gats-\nby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed\nand began to dress—I felt that I had something to\ntell him, something to warn him about, and morn-\ning would be too late.\nCrossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was\nstill open and he was leaning against a table in the\nhall, heavy with dejection or sleep.\n“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. ‘‘I waited,\nand about four o’clock she came to the window and\nstood there for a minute and then turned out the\nlight.”\nHis house had never seemed so enormous to me\nas it did that night when we hunted through the\ngreat rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside cur-\ntains that were like pavilions, and felt over innu-\nmerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—\nonce I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys\nof a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount\nof dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as\nthough they hadn’t been aired for many days. I\nfound the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two\n176\n\nTHE GREAT ‘GATSBY 177\nstale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the\nFrench windows of the drawing-room, we sat smok-\ning out into the darkness.\n“You ought to go away,” I said. ‘‘It’s pretty cer-\ntain they’ll trace your car.”\n“Go away now, old sport?”\n“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Mon-\ntreal.”’\nHe wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly\nleave Daisy until he knew what she was going to\ndo. He was clutching at some last hope and I\ncouldn’t bear to shake him free.\nIt was this night that he told me the strange story\nof his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because\n“Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s\nhard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was\nplayed out. I think that he would have acknowl-\nedged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted\nto talk about Daisy.\nShe was the first “nice” girl he had ever known.\nIn various unrevealed capacities he had come in\ncontact with such people, but always with indis-\ncernible barbed wire between. He found her excit-\ningly desirable. He went to her house, at first with\nother officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It\namazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful\nhouse before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as\ncasual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to\n\n178 THE GREAT GATSBY\nhim. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of\nbedrooms up-stairs more beautiful and cool than\nother bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking\nplace through its corridors, and of romances that\nwere not musty and laid away already in lavender\nbut fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s\nshining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were\nscarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many\nmen had already loved Daisy—it increased her value\nin his eyes. He felt their presence all about the\nhouse, pervading the air with the shades and echoes\nof still vibrant emotions.\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a\ncolossal accident. However glorious might be his\nfuture as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless\nyoung man without a past, and at any moment\nthe invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from\nhis shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He\ntook what he could get, ravenously and unscru-\npulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October\nnight, took her because he had no real right to\ntouch her hand.\nHe might have despised himself, for he had\ncertainly taken her under false pretenses. I don’t\nmean that he had traded on his phantom millions,\nbut he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of se-\ncurity; he let her believe that he was a person from\nmuch the same strata as herseli—that he was fully\nable to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 179\nno such facilities—he had no comfortable family\nstanding behind him, and he was liable at the whim\nof an impersonal government to be blown anywhere\nabout the world.\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out\nas he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to\ntake what he could and go—but now he found that\nhe had committed himself to the following of a\ngrail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but\nhe didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice”\ngirl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into\nher rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was\nGatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, be-\ntrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked\nfashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed\nher curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a\ncold, and it made her voice huskier and more charm-\ning than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly\naware of the youth and mystery that wealth im-\nprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many\nclothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and\nproud above the hot struggles of the poor.\n“T can’t describe to you how surprised I was to\nfind out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for\na while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, be-\n\n180 THE GREAT GATSBY\ncause she was in love with me too. She thought I\nknew a lot because I knew different things from her\n. . . Well, there I was, ’way off my ambitions, getting\ndeeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I\ndidn’t care. What was the use of doing great things\nif I could have a better time telling her what I was\ngoing to do?”\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he\nsat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It\nwas a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her\ncheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm al ittle, and once he kissed her dark\nshining hair. The afternoon had made them tran-\nquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for\nthe long parting the next day promised. They had\nnever been closer in their month of love, nor com-\nmunicated more profoundly one with another, than\nwhen she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoul-\nder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently,\nas though she were asleep.\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a\ncaptain before he went to the front, and following the\nArgonne battles he got his majority and the com-\nmand of the divisional machine-guns. After the ar-\nmistice he tried frantically to get home, but some\ncomplication or misunderstanding sent him to Ox-\nford instead. He was worried now—there was a\nquality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 181\ndidn’t see why he couldn’t come. She was feeling\nthe pressure of the world outside, and she wanted\nto see him and feel his presence beside her and be\nreassured that she was doing the right thing after all.\nFor Daisy was young and her artificial world was\nredolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery\nand orchestras which set the rhythm of the year,\nsumming up the sadness and suggestiveness of life\nin new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the\nhopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while\na hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled\nthe shining dust. At the gray tea hour there were\nalways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this\nlow, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and\nthere like rose petals blown by the sad horns around\nthe floor.\nThrough this twilight universe Daisy began to\nmove again with the season; suddenly she was\nagain keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a\ndozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the\nbeads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among\ndying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all\nthe time something within her was crying for a de-\ncision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately\n—and the decision must be made by some force—of\nlove, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that\nwas Close at hand.\nThat force took shape in the middle of spring with\nthe arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a whole-\n\n182 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsome bulkiness about his person and his position,\nand Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a cer-\ntain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached\nGatsby while he was still at Oxford.\nIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went\nabout opening the rest of the windows down-stairs,\nfilling the house with gray-turning, gold-turning\nlight. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the\ndew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue\nleaves. There was a slow, pleasant movement in\nthe air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.\n“T don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned\naround from a window and looked at me challeng-\ningly. ‘‘You must remember, old sport, she was very\nexcited this afternoon. He told her those things in\na way that frightened her—that made it look as if\nI was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result\nwas she hardly knew what she was saying.”\nHe sat down gloomily.\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a\nminute, when they were first married—and loved me\nmore even then, do you see?”\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n“Tn any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect\nsome intensity in his conception of the affair that\ncouldn’t be measured?\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 183\nwere still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable\nbut irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of\nhis army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together\nthrough the November night and revisiting the out-\nof-the-way places to which they had driven in her\nwhite car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed\nto him more mysterious and gay than other houses,\nso his idea of the city itself, even though she was\ngone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he\nmight have found her—that he was leaving her be-\nhind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was\nhot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down\non a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the\nbacks of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out\ninto the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced\nthem for a minute with people in it who might once\nhave seen the pale magic of her face along the casual\nstreet.\nThe track curved and now it was going away from\nthe sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread\nitself in benediction over the vanishing city where\nshe had drawn her breath. He stretched out his\nhand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air,\nto save a fragment of the spot that she had made\nlovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now\nfor his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost\nthat part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n184 THE GREAT GATSBY\nIt was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast\nand went out on the porch. The night had made a\nsharp difference in the weather and there was an\nautumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one\nof Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the\nsteps.\n“T’m going to drain the pool to-day, Mr. Gatsby.\nLeaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s\nalways trouble with the pipes.”\n“Don’t do it to-day,’ Gatsby answered. He\nturned to me apologetically. “You know, old sport,\nI’ve never used that pool all summer?”\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n“Twelve minutes to my train,”\nI didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a\ndecent stroke of work, but it was more than that—\nI didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train,\nand then another, before I could get myself away.\n“T’ll call you up,” I said finally.\n“Do, old sport.”\n“T’ll call you about noon.”\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n“T suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me\nanxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.\n“‘T suppose so.”\n“Well, good-by.”\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before\nI reached the hedge I remembered something and\nturned around.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 185\n“‘They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the\nlawn. “You're worth the whole damn bunch put\ntogether.”\nI’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only\ncompliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved\nof him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant\nand understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic\ncahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink\nrag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps, and I thought of the night when I first\ncame to his ancestral home, three months before.\nThe lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces\nof those who guessed at his corruption—and he had\nstood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible\ndream, as he waved them good-by.\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were al-\nways thanking him for that—I and the others.\n““Good-by,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast,\nGatsby.”\nUp in the city, I tried for a while to list the quo-\ntations on an interminable amount of stock, then\nI fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon\nthe phone woke me, and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker;\nshe often called me up at this hour because the un-\ncertainty of her own movements between hotels\nand clubs and private houses made her hard to find.\n\n186 THE GREAT GATSBY\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the\nwire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from\na green golf-links had come sailing in at the office\nwindow, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n“T’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at\nHempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton\nthis afternoon.”\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house,\nbut the act annoyed me, and her next remark made\nme rigid.\n“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”\n“How could it have mattered then?”\nSilence for a moment. Then:\n““However—I want to see you.”\n“T want to see you, too.”\n“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come\ninto town this afternoon?”\n“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”\n“Very well.”\n“Tt’s impossible this afternoon. Various——’ >\nWe talked like that for a while, and then abruptly\nwe weren’t talking any longer. I don’t know which\nof us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn’t\ncare. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-\ntable that day if I never talked to her again in this\nworld.\nTI called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but\nthe line was busy. I tried four times; finally an ex-\nasperated central told me the wire was being kept\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 187\nopen for long distance from Detroit. Taking out\nmy time-table, I drew a small circle around the\nthree-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair\nand tried to think. It was just noon.\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that\nmorning I had crossed deliberately to the other side\nof the car. I supposed there’d be a curious crowd\naround there all day with little boys searching for\ndark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man tell-\ning over and over what had happened, until it be-\ncame less and less real even to him and he could\ntell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achieve-\nment was forgotten. Now I want to go back a\nlittle and tell what happened at the garage after\nwe left there the night before.\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.\nShe must have broken her rule against drinking that\nnight, for when she arrived she was stupid with\nliquor and unable to understand that the ambulance\nhad already gone to Flushing. When they convinced\nher of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was\nthe intolerable part of the affair. Some one, kind or\ncurious, took her in his car and drove her in the\nwake of her sister’s body.\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped\nup against the front of the garage, while George Wil-\nson rocked himself back and forth on the couch in-\nside. For a while the door of the office was open, and\n\n188 THE GREAT GATSBY\nevery one who came into the garage glanced irresis-\ntibly through it. Finally some one said it was a\nshame, and closed the door. Michaelis and several\nother men were with him; first, four or five men,\nlater two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to\nask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes\nlonger, while he went back to his own place and\nmade a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there\nalone with Wilson until dawn.\nAbout three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s inco-\nherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and\nbegan to talk about the yellow car. He announced\nthat he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car\nbelonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of\nmonths ago his wife had come from the city with her\nface bruised and her nose swollen.\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched\nand began to cry “‘Oh, my God!” again in his groan-\ning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to dis-\ntract him.\n“How long have you been married, George?\nCome on there, try and sit still a minute and answer\nmy question. How long have you been married?”\n“Twelve years.”\n“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit\nstill—I asked you a question. Did you ever have\nany children?”\nThe hard brown beetles kept thudding against the\ndull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 189\ntearing along the road outside it sounded to him like\nthe car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before. He\ndidn’t like to go into the garage, because the work\nbench was stained where the body had been lying,\nso he moved uncomfortably around the office—he\nknew every object in it before morning—and from\ntime to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep\nhim more quiet.\n“Have you got a church you go to sometimes,\nGeorge? Maybe even if you haven’t been there for\na long time? Maybe I could call up the church and\nget a priest to come over and he could talk to you,\nsee?”\n“Don’t belong to any.”\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times\nlike this. You must have gone to church once.\nDidn’t you get married inachurch? Listen, George,\nlisten to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\n“That was a long time ago.”\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his\nrocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the\nsame half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back\ninto his faded eyes.\n“‘Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at\nthe desk.\n“Which drawer?”\n“That drawer—that one.”\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.\nThere was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-\n\n190 THE GREAT GATSBY\nleash, made of leather and braided silver. It was\napparently new.\n“This?” he inquired, holding it up.\nWilson stared and nodded.\n“T found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell\nme about it, but I knew it was something funny.”\n“You mean your wife bought it?”\n“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her\nbureau.”\nMichaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he\ngave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might\nhave bought the dog-leash. But conceivably Wilson\nhad heard some of these same explanations before,\nfrom Myrtle, because he began saying ‘Oh, my\nGod !” again in a whisper—his comforter left several\nexplanations in the air.\n“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth\ndropped open suddenly.\n“Who did?”\n“T have a way of finding out.”\n““You’re morbid, George,”’ said his friend. ‘‘This\nhas been a strain to you and you don’t know what\nyou’re saying. You’d better try and sit quiet till\nmorning.”\n“He murdered her.”\n“It was an accident, George.”\nWilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and\nhis mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a su-\nperior ‘Hm !”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY IQI\n“TI know,” he said definitely, ‘I’m one of these\ntrusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody,\nbut when I get to know a thing I know it. It was\nthe man in that car. She ran out to speak to him\nand he wouldn’t stop.”\nMichaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred\nto him that there was any special significance in it.\nHe believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running\naway from her husband, rather than trying to stop\nany particular car.\n“How could she of been like that?”\n“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that an-\nswered the question. “Ah-h-h——-”\nHe began to rock again, and Michaelis stood\ntwisting the leash in his hand.\n“Maybe you got some friend that I could tele-\nphone for, George ?”’\nThis was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that\nWilson had no friend: there was not enough of him\nfor his wife. He was glada l ittle later when he no-\nticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by\nthe window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off.\nAbout five o’clock it was blue enough outside to\nsnap off the light.\nWilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps,\nwhere small gray clouds took on fantastic shapes\nand scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.\n“‘T spoke to her,”’ he muttered, after a long silence.\n“T told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool\n\n192 THE GREAT GATSBY\nGod. I took her to the window”—with an effort he\ngot up and walked to the rear window and leaned\nwith his face pressed against it—‘‘and I said ‘God\nknows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve\nbeen doing. You may fool me, but you can’t fool\nGod !’”\nStanding behind him, Michaelis saw with a\nshock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T.\nJ. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and\nenormous, from the dissolving night.\n“God sees everything,”’ repeated Wilson.\n““That’s an advertisement,”’ Michaelis assured him.\nSomething made him turn away from the window\nand look back into the room. But Wilson stood\nthere a long time, his face close to the window pane,\nnodding into the twilight.\nBy six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grate-\nful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was\none of the watchers of the night before who had\npromised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for\nthree, which he and the other man ate together.\nWilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home\nto sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hur-\nried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.\nHis movements—he was on foot all the time—\nwere afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then\nto Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he\ndidn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 193\ntired and walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s\nHill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in\naccounting for his time—there were boys who had\nseen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at\nwhom he stared oddly from the side of the road.\nThen for three hours he disappeared from view.\nThe police, on the strength of what he said to\nMichaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,”\nsupposed that he spent that time going from gar-\nage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow\ncar. On the other hand, no garage man who had\nseen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had\nan easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted\nto know. By half-past two he was in West Egg,\nwhere he asked some one the way to Gatsby’s house.\nSo by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.\nAt two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit\nand left word with the butler that if any one phoned\nword was to be brought to him at the pool. He\nstopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that\nhad amused his guests during the summer, and the\nchauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he gave in-\nstructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out\nunder any circumstances—and this was strange, be-\ncause the front right fender needed repair.\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for\nthe pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little,\nand the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but\n\n194 THE GREAT GATSBY\nhe shook his head and in a moment disappeared\namong the yellowing trees.\nNo telephone message arrived, but the butler\nwent without his sleep and waited for it until four\no’clock—until long after there was any one to give\nit to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself\ndidn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no\nlonger cared. If that was true he must have felt that\nhe had lost the old warm world, paid a high price\nfor living too long with a single dream. He must\nhave looked up at an unfamiliar sky through fright-\nening leaves and shivered as he found what a gro-\ntesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was\nupon the scarcely created grass. A new world, ma-\nterial without being real, where poor ghosts, breath-\ning dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about .. .\nlike that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him\nthrough the amorphous trees.\nThe chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s proté-\ngés—heard the shots—afterward he could only say\nthat he hadn’t thought anything much about them.\nI drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house\nand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was\nthe first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew\nthen, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said,\nfour of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I,\nhurried down to the pool.\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement\nof the water as the fresh flow from one end urged\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 195\nits way toward the drain at the other. With little\nripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the\nladen mattress moved irregularly down the pool.\nA small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the\nsurface was enough to disturb its accidental course\nwith its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster\nof leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of\ntransit, a thin red circle in the water.\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the\nhouse that the gardener saw Wilson’s body al ittle\nway off in the grass, and the holocaust was com-\nplete.\n\nCHAPTER IX\nAFTER two years I remember the rest of that day,\nand that night and the next day, only as an endless\ndrill of police and photographers and newspaper\nmen in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope\nstretched across the main gate and a policeman by\nit kept out the curious, but little boys soon discov-\nered that they could enter through my yard, and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-\nmouthed about the pool. Some one with a positive\nmanner, perhaps a detective, used the expression\n“madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that\nafternoon, and the adventitious authority of his\nvoice set the key for the newspaper reports next\nmorning.\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—gro-\ntesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When\nMichaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light\nWilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole\ntale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade\n—but Catherine, who might have said anything,\ndidn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\nof character about it too—looked at the coroner with\ndetermined eyes under that corrected brow of hers,\nand swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby,\nthat her sister was completely happy with her hus-\n196\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 197\nband, that her sister had been into no mischief\nwhatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into\nher handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\nman ‘deranged by grief” in order that the case\nmight remain in its simplest form. And it rested\nthere.\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessen-\ntial. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone.\nFrom the moment I telephoned news of the catas-\ntrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about\nhim, and every practical question, was referred to\nme. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as\nhe lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was\nresponsible, because no one else was interested—\ninterested, I mean, with that intense personal in-\nterest to which every one has some vague right at\nthe end.\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him,\ncalled her instinctively and without hesitation. But\nshe and Tom had gone away early that afternoon,\nand taken baggage with them.\n“Left no address?”\n“cNs o.”\n““Say when they’d be back?”\n“No.”\n“Any idea where they are? How I could reach\nthem?”\n\n198 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T don’t know. Can’t say.”\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to\ngo into the room where he lay and reassure him:\n“T’'ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry.\nJust trust me and I’ll get somebody for you ye\nMeyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone\nbook. The butler gave me his office address on\nBroadway, and I called Information, but by the\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and\nno one answered the phone.\n“Will you ring again?”\n“T’ve rung them three times.”\n“It’s very important.”\n“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for\nan instant that they were chance visitors, all these\nofficial people who suddenly filled it. But, though\nthey drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get some-\nbody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go\nthrough this alone.”\nSome one started to ask me questions, but I broke\naway and going up-stairs looked hastily through\nthe unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead. But there\nwas nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token\nof forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 199\na letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information\nand urged him to come out on the next train. That\nrequest seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was\nsure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just\nas I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before\nnoon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived;\nno one arrived except more police and photographers\nand newspaper men. When the butler brought back\nWolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of de-\nfiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and\nme against them all.\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most\nterrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that\nit is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should\nmake us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up\nin some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can doa l ittle later\nlet me know ina letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I\nam when I hear about a thing like this and am completely\nknocked down and out.\nYours truly\nMEYER WOLFSHIEM\nand then hasty addenda beneath:\nLet me know about the funeral etc do not know his\nfamily at all.\nWhen the phone rang that afternoon and Long\nDistance said Chicago was calling I thought this\n\n200 THE GREAT GATSBY\nwould be Daisy at last. But the connection came\nthrough as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.\n“This is Slagle speaking . . .”\n“Ves?” The name was unfamiliar.\n“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,’ he said rapidly.\n‘They picked him up when he handed the bonds over\nthe counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving ’°em the numbers just five minutes before.\nWhat d’you know about that, hey? You never can\ntell in these hick towns——”\n“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. ‘‘Look here\n—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the\nwire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick\nsquawk as the connection was broken.\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram\nsigned Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minne-\nsota. It said only that the sender was leaving im-\nmediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\nIt was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very\nhelpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap\nulster against the warm September day. His eyes\nleaked continuously with excitement, and when I\ntook the bag and umbrella from his hands he began\nto pull so incessantly at his sparse gray beard that\nI had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 201\nthe point of collapse, so I took him into the music\nroom and made him sit down while I sent for some-\nthing to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of\nmilk spilled from his trembling hand.\n“T saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said.\n“Tt was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started\nright away.”\n“T didn’t know how to reach you.”\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about\nthe room.\n“Tt was a madman,” he said. “He must have\nbeen mad.”\n“‘Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.\n“JT don’t want anything. I’m all right now,\nMr—”’\n“Carraway.”\n“Well, I’m all night now. Where have they got\nJimmy ?” |\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son\nlay, and left him there. Some little boys had come\nup on the steps and were looking into the hall; when\nI told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly\naway.\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and\ncame out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly,\nhis eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He\nhad reached an age where death no longer has the\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked\naround him now for the first time and saw the\n\n202 THE GREAT GATSBY\nheight and splendor of the hall and the great rooms\nopening out from it into other rooms, his grief be-\ngan to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to\na bedroom up-stairs; while he took off his coat and\nvest I told him that all arrangements had been de-\nferred until he came.\n“T didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby’\n“Gatz is my name.”\n“Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take\nthe body West.”\nHe shook his head.\n“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He\nrose up to his position in the East. Were you a\nfriend of my boy’s, Mr. ——?”\n“We were close friends.”\n“He had a big future before him, you know. He\nwas only a young man, but he had al ot of brain\npower here.”\nHe touched his head impressively, and I nodded.\n“Tf he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A\nman like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the\ncountry.”\n“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.\nHe fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying\nto take it from the bed, and lay down stiffy—was in-\nstantly asleep.\nThat night an obviously frightenea person called\nup, and demanded to know who I was before he\nwould give his name.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 203\n“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.\n“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klip-\nspringer.”\nI was relieved too, for that seemed to promise an-\nother friend at Gatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to\nbe in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so\nI'd been calling up a few people myself. They were\nhard to find.\n“‘The funeral’s to-morrow,” I said. ‘‘ Three o’clock,\nhere at the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d\nbe interested.”\n“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course\nI’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.”\nHis tone made me suspicious.\n“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”\nWell, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about\nis——”’\n“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about\nsaying you’ll come?”\n“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that\nI’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich,\nand they rather expect me to be with them to-\nmorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or some-\nthing. Of course I'll do my very best to get\naway.”\nI ejaculated an unrestrained “Hun!” and he\nmust have heard me, for he went on nervously:\n‘What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left\nthere. I wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have\n\n204 THE GREAT GATSBY\nthe butler send them on. You see, they’re tennis\nshoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. My\naddress is care of B. F——”\nI didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung\nup the receiver.\nAfter that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one\ngentleman to whom It elephoned implied that he had\ngot what he deserved. However, that was my fault,\nfor he was one of those who used to sneer most bit-\nterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor,\nand I should have known better than to call him.\nThe morning of the funeral I went up to New\nYork to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to\nreach him any other way. The door that I pushed\nopen, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked\n“The Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there\ndidn’t seem to be any one inside. But when I’d\nshouted “‘hello” several times in vain, an argument\nbroke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely\nJewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized\nme with black hostile eyes.\n““Nobody’s in,” she said. ‘Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone\nto Chicago.”\nThe first part of this was obviously untrue, for\nsome one had begun to whistle “The Rosary,” tune-\nlessly, inside.\n“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”\n“T can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”\nAt this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfs-\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 205\nhiem’s, called ‘‘Stella!” from the other side of the\ndoor.\n“‘Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly.\n“T’ll give it to him when he gets back.”\n“But I know he’s there.”\nShe took a step toward me and began to slide her\nhands indignantly up and down her hips.\n“You young men think you can force your way\nin here any time,” she scolded. ‘‘We’re getting sick\nin tired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in\nChicago.”\nI mentioned Gatsby.\n“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “‘ Will you\njust— What was your name?”\nShe vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim\nstood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both\nhands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a\nreverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us,\nand offered me ac igar.\n“My memory goes back to when first I met him,”\nhe said. ‘‘A young major just out of the army and\ncovered over with medals he got in the war. He was\nso hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\nbecause he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First\ntime I saw him was when he come into Winebren-\nner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for\na job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days.\n“Come on have some lunch with me,’ I sid. He ate\nmore than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\n\n206 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n“Start him! I made him.”\ncc Oh.”’\n“T raised him up out of nothing, right out of the\ngutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing,\ngentlemanly young man, and when he told me he\nwas an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I\ngot him to join up in the American Legion and he\nused to stand high there. Right off he did some\nwork for a client of mine up to Albany. We were\nso thick like that in everything”—he held up two\nbulbous fingers—‘‘always together.”\nT wondered if this partnership had included the\nWorld’s Series transaction in 1919.\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. ‘‘ You\nwere his closest friend, so I know you'll want to\ncome to his funeral this afternoon.”\n“T’d like to come.”\n“Well, come then.”\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as\nhe shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\n“T can’t doit—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he\nsaid.\n“‘There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over\nnow.”\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed\nup in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a\nyoung man it was different—if a friend of mine died,\nno matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 207\nmay think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the\nbitter end.”\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was de-\ntermined not to come, so I stood up.\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest\na “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my\nhand.\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man\nwhen he is alive and not after he is dead,” he sug-\ngested. “After that my own rule is to let everything\nalone.”\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and\nI got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing\nmy clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz\nwalking up and down excitedly in the hall. His\npride in his son and in his son’s possessions was con-\ntinually increasing and now he had something to\nshow me.\n‘Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his\nwallet with trembling fingers. “Look there.”\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the\ncorners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out\nevery detail to me eagerly. ‘Look there!” and then\nsought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it\nso often that I think it was more real to him now\nthan the house itself.\n‘Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty\npicture. It shows up well.”\n\n208 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”\n‘He come out to see me two years ago and bought\nme the house I live in now. Of course we was broke\nup when he run off from home, but I see now there\nwas a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in\nfront of him. And ever since he made a success he\nwas very generous with me.”\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held\nit for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes.\nThen he returned the wallet and pulled from his\npocket a ragged old copy of a book called “ Hop-\nalong Cassidy.”\n“‘Look here, this is a book he had when he was a\nboy. It just shows you.”\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it\naround for me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed\nthe word SCHEDULE, and the date Septeraber 12,\n1906. And underneath:\nRisé: from bed ss ccsses cadens eeewennaece s 6.00 A.M.\nDumbbell exercise and wall-scaling ........ 6.15-6.30 “\nStudy electricity, etc.................000, 7.15-8.15 ‘\nWork i c.05 Bh eat ON a oa seh eee 8.30-4.30 P.

He always had\nsome resolves like this or something. Do you notice\nwhat he’s got about improving his mind? He was\nalways great for that. He told me I et like a hog\nonce, and I beat him for it.”\nHe was reluctant to close the book, reading each\nitem aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think\nhe rather expected me to copy down the list for my\nown use.\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived\nfrom Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily\nout the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby’s\nfather. And as the time passed and the servants\ncame in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes\nbegan to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain\nin a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch, so I took him aside and\nasked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn’t\nany use. Nobody came.\nAbout five o’clock our procession of three cars\nreached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle\n\n210 THE GREAT GATSBY\nbeside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black\nand wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in\nthe limousine, anda l ittle later four or five servants\nand the postman from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station\nwagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the\ngate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the\nsound of some one splashing after us over the soggy\nground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-\neyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gats-\nby’s books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\nI'd never seen him since then. I don’t know how\nhe knew about the funeral, or even his name. The\nrain poured down his thick glasses, and he took\nthem off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas\nunrolled from Gatsby’s grave.\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment,\nbut he was already too far away, and I could only\nremember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t\nsent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard some one\nmurmur ‘‘Blessed are the dead that the rain falls\non,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to\nthat,” in a brave voice.\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to\nthe cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.\n“T couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.\n“Neither could anybody else.”\n“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used\nto go there by the hundreds.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 211\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again,\noutside and in.\n“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back\nWest from prep school and later from college at\nChristmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Street\nstation at six o’clock of a December evening, with a\nfew Chicago friends, already caught up into their\nown holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by.\nI remember the fur coats of the girls returning from\nMiss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath\nand the hands waving overhead as we caught sight\nof old acquaintances, and the matchings of invita-\ntions: “‘Are you going to the Ordways’? the Her-\nseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets\nclasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the\nmurky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St.\nPaul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on\nthe tracks beside the gate.\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the\nreal snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us\nand twinkle against the windows, and the dim\nlights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp\nwild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in\ndeep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner\nthrough the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of\n\n212 THE GREAT GATSBY\nour identity with this country for one strange hour,\nbefore we melted indistinguishably into it again.\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the\nprairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling\nreturning trains of my youth, and the street lamps\nand sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows\nof holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the\nsnow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the\nfeel of those long winters, a little complacent from\ngrowing up in the Carraway house in a city where\ndwellings are still called through decades by a\nfamily’s name. I see now that this has been a story\nof the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we\npossessed some deficiency in common which made\nus subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\nEven when the East excited me most, even when\nI was most keenly aware of its superiority to the\nbored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio,\nwith their interminable inquisitions which spared\nonly the children and the very old—even then it\nhad always for me a quality of distortion. West\nEgg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a\nhundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque,\ncrouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a\nlustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn\nmen in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk\nwith a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 213\na white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles\nover the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely\nthe men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But\nno one knows the woman’s name, and no one\ncares.\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for\nme like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of\ncorrection. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves\nwas in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry\nstiff on the line I decided to come back home.\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an\nawkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better\nhave been let alone. But I wanted to leave things\nin order and not just trust that obliging and in-\ndifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan\nBaker and talked over and around what had hap-\npened to us together, and what had happened after-\nward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in\na big chair.\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember\nthinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin\nraised a little jauntily, her hair the color of an\nautumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the\nfingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished\nshe told me without comment that she was en-\ngaged to another man. I doubted that, though there\nwere several she could have married at a nod of her\nhead, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a\nminute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake,\n\n214 THE GREAT GATSBY\nthen I thought it all over again quickly and got up\nto say good-by.\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jor-\ndan suddenly. “‘ You threw me over on the telephone.\nI don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a\nnew experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for\na while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—‘a\nconversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why—not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she\nmet another bad driver? Well, I met another bad\ndriver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to\nmake such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather\nan honest, straightforward person. I thought it was\nyour secret pride.”\n“T’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie\nto myself and call it honor.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with\nher, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Bu-\nchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth\nAvenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference,\nhis head moving sharply here and there, adapting\nitself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to\navoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning\n> be\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 215\ninto the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he\nsaw me and walked back, holding out his hand.\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to ,\nshaking hands with me?”\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy\nas hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson - ©\nthat afternoon?”\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I\nhad guessed right about those missing hours. I\nstarted to turn away, but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n“T told him the truth,” he said. ‘‘He came to the\ndoor while we were getting ready to leave, and when\nI sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to\nforce his way up-stairs. He was crazy enough to\nkill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car.\nHis hand was on a revolver in his pocket every\nminute he was in the house—” He broke off de-\nfiantly. “‘What if I did tell him? That fellow had\nit coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes\njust like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one.\nHe ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and\nnever even stopped his car.”\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one un-\nutterable fact that it wasn’t true.\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffer-\ning—look here, when I went to give up that flat\n\n216 THE GREAT GATSBY\nand saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there\non the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby.\nBy God it was awful——”\n1 couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that\nwhat he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It\nwas all very careless and confused. They were care-\nless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up\nthings and creatures and then retreated back into\ntheir money or their vast carelessness, or whatever\nit was that kept them together, and let other people\nclean up the mess they had made. ...\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for\nI felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.\nThen he went into the jewelry store to buy a\npearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff but-\ntons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.\nGatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the\ngrass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One\nof the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare\npast the entrance gate without stopping for a min-\nute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove\nDaisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the\naccident, and perhaps he had made a story about\nit all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided\nhim when I got off the train.\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because\nthose gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with\nme so vividly that I could still hear the music and\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 217\nthe laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,\nand the cars going up and down his drive. One\nnight I did hear a material car there, and saw its\nlights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investi-\ngate. Probably it was some final guest who had\nbeen away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know\nthat the party was over.\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my\ncar sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at\nthat huge incoherent failure of a house once more.\nOn the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by\nsome boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in\nthe moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe\nraspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down\nto the beach and sprawled out on the sand.\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and\nthere were hardly any lights except the shadowy,\nmoving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And\nas the moon rose higher the inessential houses began\nto melt away until gradually I became aware of\nthe old island here that flowered once for Dutch\nsailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for\nGatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to\nthe last and greatest of all human dreams; for a\ntransitory enchanted moment man must have held\nhis breath in the presence of this continent, com-\npelled into an esthetic contemplation he neither un-\nderstood nor desired, face to face for the last time\n\n218 THE GREAT GATSBY\nin history with something commensurate to his\ncapacity for wonder.\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown\nworld, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first\npicked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock.\nHe had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his\ndream must have seemed so close that he could\nhardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it\nwas already behind him, somewhere back in that\nvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark\nfields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic\nfuture that year by year recedes before us. It eluded\nus then, but that’s no matter—to-morrow we will\nrun faster, stretch out our arms farther. ... And\none fine morning——\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne\nback ceaselessly into the past.",
