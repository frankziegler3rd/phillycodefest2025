We had a brief affair before she married old Tom, but I never gave up hope that we could rekindle our romance.\n\nLately, though, things have been getting complicated. Daisy's husband, Tom, is a brutish fellow who doesn't deserve her. And then there's Jordan Baker, a sporty flapper who's caught my eye. She's got a certain... je ne sais quoi that I find irresistible. But deep down, I know it's all just a distraction from the real prize: winning Daisy back.\n\nI've been working tirelessly to recreate the magic of our past, trying to relive those stolen moments when we were young and in love. It's an uphill battle, but I'm convinced that if I can just get her to see me again, to remember how it felt to be with me... well, maybe, just maybe, we can recapture what we had.\n\nBut life's not always as straightforward as I'd like it to be. Old rivalries and secrets threaten to tear everything apart. Still, I'll keep chasing my dream, no matter the cost.

Schraeders, Stonewall Jackson Abrams, and Fishguards\n* Movie personalities, like S.B. Whitebait and Maurice A.

As Gatsby, my true concern is not with the mysteries of the quantum realm but rather with the human condition.
