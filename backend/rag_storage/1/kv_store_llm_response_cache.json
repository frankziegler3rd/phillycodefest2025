      "return": "(\" **Entities and Relationships**\")\r\n* **Characters:**  Daisy Buchanan, Tom Buchanan, Miss Baker, Narrator (likely Nick Carraway), Butler (mentioned)\r\n* **Setting/Context:** A dinner gathering at Tom and Daisy's estate, likely on Long Island during the Roaring Twenties. The atmosphere is a mix of polite social convention and underlying tensions.\r\n* **Key Themes/Plot Points (Emerging):**\r\n    * **Social Decay and Superficiality:**  Conversations touch on \"civilization going to pieces,\" with Tom espousing racist and pseudoscientific ideas about racial dominance. Daisy and Miss Baker engage in seemingly light banter masking a deeper unease.\r\n    * **Power Dynamics and Manipulation:** Tom asserts his dominance through opinions and narratives, while Daisy subtly plays along or offers veiled dissent (like the \"wink\" and mentioning a family secret).\r\n    * **Hidden Truths and Secrets:**  Daisy's whisper about the butler's nose hints at a desire to share something intimate and perhaps scandalous, adding a layer of intrigue.\r\n    * **Contrasts and Irony:** The discussion of  \"the longest day\" juxtaposed with their awareness of time passing quickly and casually emphasizes a sense of emptiness or missed opportunities.\r\n\r\n(\" **Specific Entity Analysis and Connections'')**\r\n\r\n* **Daisy Buchanan:** Appears both compliant and subtly rebellious. Her \"unthoughtful sadness,\" winks, and interest in sharing a secret suggest a complex personality navigating societal expectations and personal truths.\r\n* **Tom Buchanan:**  Driven by a flawed sense of superiority rooted in racial theories and a need to control narratives. His insistence on scientific justification highlights his intellectual posturing while masking insecurity.\r\n* **Miss Baker:**  Embodies the cool detachment often associated with the social elite. Her casual remarks and acceptance of the situation point to a weariness with pretense.\r\n* **Narrator (Nick):** Acts as an observer, drawn into their world but slightly alienated. His questions about \"crops\" reveal a yearning for genuineness amidst the artifice.\r\n* **Butler (Symbolic):**  His nose becomes a symbol of a hidden story, representing unspoken truths and perhaps the vulnerability behind the facade of wealth and power. \r\n\r\n**Continuing Narrative Trajectory:**  The excerpt sets up a tension between outward appearances and underlying currents of dissatisfaction, racism, and veiled secrets. Expect further exploration of these themes as Daisy's secret unfolds and interactions reveal deeper character motivations.",

Key traits:\r\n    * **Reserved Judgments:** He values understanding over quick criticism, learned from his father's advice. This makes him a keen listener to confidences, though sometimes weary of them.\r\n    * **Yearning for Order & Meaning:** After WWI, he seeks stability and purpose amidst the perceived \"riotousness\" of life, a desire somewhat at odds with the  world Gatsby inhabits.\r\n    * **Moral Compass:** While tolerant, he has a limit – a sense of fundamental decency guides him, hinting at underlying values.\r\n* **Gatsby (Jay Gatsby):** Introduced indirectly but as a central enigma. Nick acknowledges Gatsby's captivating aura despite his scorn for Gatsby's \"type.\" \r\n    * **\"Gorgeousness\" & Heightened Sensitivity:**  Gatsby embodies a romantic hopefulness and connection to life's possibilities, unlike ordinary men.\r\n    * **Mysterious Past & Dreams:** Gatsby's backstory and the \"foul dust\" haunting his dreams pique Nick's curiosity, suggesting a complex narrative unfolding.\r\n* **Family Background (Carraways):**  Established as prominent, traditional, and with a lineage tied to wealth and business. This contrasts with Gatsby's undefined origins, adding to the tension.\r\n    * **Emphasis on Legacy & Security:** Nick's upbringing emphasizes stability and inherited success, a world different from Gatsby's pursuit.\r\n\r\n**Emerging Themes:**\r\n\r\n* **The American Dream & Illusion:** Gatsby's character foreshadows a complex exploration of chasing aspirations, wealth, and love in a society marked by disparity.\r\n* **Past vs. Present:** Nick's reflection on his \"younger and more vulnerable years\" and the yearning for a simpler world set against the backdrop of post-war disillusionment.\r\n* **Social Classes & Perception:**  The contrast between Nick's established family and Gatsby's enigmatic persona hints at societal divisions and judgments based on Herkunft (origin).\r\n* **Hope & Disillusionment:** While Nick initially seeks order, Gatsby embodies a potent hopefulness that both attracts and perplexes him, suggesting a central conflict within the novel. \r\n\r\n**Narrative Style:**  First-person narration allows for intimate insights into Nick's thoughts and gradual unveiling of the Gatsby enigma. The prose is elegant yet carries undercurrents of introspection and foreshadowing.",

SCOTT FITZGERALD\nThen wear the gold hat, if that will move her;\nIf you can bounce high, bounce for her too,\nTill she cry “Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,\nI must have you!”\n—Tuomas Parke D’Invitusras.\nNEW YORK\nCHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS\n1925\n\nCopyricnt, 1925, sy\nCHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS\nPrinted in the United States of America\n\nONCE AGAIN\nTO\nZELDA\nHcoe,a\naly\nS4 er\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY\nCHAPTER I\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father\ngave me some advice that I’ve been turning over\nin my mind ever since.\n“Whenever you feel like criticising any one,” he\ntold me, ‘‘just remember that all the people in this\nworld haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”\nHe didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been\nunusually communicative in a reserved way, and I\nunderstood that he meant a great deal more than\nthat. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all\njudgments, a habit that has opened up many curi-\nous natures to me and also made me the victim of\nnot a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is\nquick to detect and attach itself to this quality\nwhen it appears in a normal person, and so it came\nabout that in college I was unjustly accused of\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret\ngriefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences\nwere unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,\npreoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation\nwas quivering on the horizon; for the intimate\nrevelations of young men, or at least the terms in\nI\n\n2 THE GREAT GATSBY\nwhich they express them, are usually plagiaristic\nand marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a\nlittle afraid of missing something if I forget that, as\nmy father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is par-\ncelled out unequally at birth.\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I\ncome to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct\nmay be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,\nbut after a certain point I don’t care what it’s\nfounded on. When I came back from the East last\nautumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in\nuniform and at a sort of moral attention forever;\nI wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged\nglimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the\nman who gives his name to this book, was exempt\nfrom my reaction—Gatsby, who represented every-\nthing for which I have an unaffected scorn. If per-\nsonality is an unbroken series of successful gestures,\nthen there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if\nhe were related to one of those intricate machines\nthat register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.\nThis responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the\nname of the ‘creative temperament”—it was an\nextraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness\nsuch as I have never found in any other person and\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 3\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—\nGatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what\npreyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\ninterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded\nelations of men.\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do peo-\nple in this Middle Western city for three generations.\nThe Carraways are something of a clan, and we have\na tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes\nof Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was\nmy grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-\none, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started\nthe wholesale hardware business that my father car-\nries on to-day.\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to\nlook like him—with special reference to the rather\nhard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office.\nI graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quar-\nter of a century after my father, and al ittle later I\nparticipated in that delayed Teutonic migration\nknown as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-\nraid so thoroughly that I came back restless. In-\nstead of being the warm centre of the world, the\nMiddle West now seemed like the ragged edge of\nthe universe—so I decided to go East and learn the\nbond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond\nbusiness, so I supposed it could support one more\n\n4 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsingle man.

Tom deferred\nthat much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers\nwho might be on the train.\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured\nmuslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide\nhips as Tom helped her to the platform in New\nYork. At the news-stand she bought a copy of Town\nTattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the\nstation drug-store some cold cream and a small\n\n32 THE GREAT GATSBY\nflask of perfume. Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing\ndrive she let four taxicabs drive away before she\nselected a new one, lavender-colored with gray up-\nholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of\nthe station into the glowing sunshine. But im-\nmediately she turned sharply from the window and,\nleaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\n“T want to get one of those dogs,” she said ear-\nnestly. ‘I want to get one forthe apartment. They’re\nnice to have—a dog.”\nWe backed up to a gray old man who bore an\nabsurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a\nbasket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson\neagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n*1’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t\nsuppose you got that kind?”\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket,\nplunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling,\nby the back of the neck.\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man\nwith disappointment in his voice. ‘‘It’s more of an\nAiredale.”’ He passed his hand over the brown wash-\nrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat.\nThat’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching\ncold.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 33\n“T think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusias-\ntically. “How much is it?”\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That\ndog will cost you ten dollars.”\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale\nconcerned in it somewhere, though its feet were\nstartlingly white—changed hands and settled down\ninto Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weather-\nproof coat with rapture.\n“Ts it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. ‘“‘Here’s your\nmoney. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft,\nalmost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon.\nI wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock\nof white sheep turn the corner.\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you\nhere.”\n“No, you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly.\n“Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the\napartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n“Come on,” she urged. “‘I’ll telephone my sister\nCatherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by peo-\nple who ought to know.”\n“Well, I'd like to, but——”\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park\ntoward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the\ncab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\n\n34 THE GREAT GATSBY\napartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming\nglance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gath-\nered up her dog and her other purchases, and went\nhaughtily in.\n“Ym going to have the McKees come up,” she\nannounced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of\ncourse, I got to call up my sister, too.”\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small\nliving-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom,\nand a bath. The living-room was crowded to the\ndoors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too\nlarge for it, so that to move about was to stumble\ncontinually over scenes of ladies swinging in the\ngardens of Versailles.

Possesses a \"supercilious manner\" and paternal contempt, suggesting arrogance and a need for control.  His relationship with Nick (narrator) is one of perceived approval tinged with wistfulness from Tom's side.\r\n* **Daisy Buchanan:** Mentioned indirectly, appears elegant and somewhat ethereal (\"buoyed up...like an anchored balloon\"). Her motivations and feelings are veiled, leaving an impression of someone drifting along rather than actively directing her life. Nick senses a disconnect between Daisy's claims and her actual tendencies (permanent move to East Egg doubted).\r\n* **Two Young Women (on the Divan):** One is unnamed and a stranger to Nick, the other implied to be Daisy (though not directly stated). Their stillness and white attire create a contrast with the dynamic windswept environment, emphasizing their passivity within Tom's world.\r\n* **Nick Carraway (Narrator):** Observant, somewhat detached, acts as a lens through which we perceive Tom and the atmosphere. He picks up on subtle cues and undercurrents in their interactions.\r\n\r\n**Setting & Atmosphere:**\r\n* **East Egg Mansion:** Extravagant, meticulously designed (\"cheerful red-and-white... Georgian Colonial\"), showcasing wealth and a sense of staged perfection. The sprawling lawn and gardens emphasize vastness and a carefully cultivated image.\r\n* **Dynamic Wind:**  A constant presence, whipping curtains, rugs, and embodying a restless energy that contrasts with the static figures (especially the women on the divan). This reflects the underlying tension and unspoken currents within the house.\r\n* **Sensory Details:** Vivid descriptions (glowing windows, pungent roses, wine-colored rug) create a lush but slightly unsettling ambiance.  The \"boom\" of closed windows silencing the wind adds a layer of control and suppression.\r\n\r\n**Themes Emerging (Early in the Narrative):**\r\n* **Wealth and Illusion:**  The ostentatious setting masks deeper complexities and possibly emptiness within the characters' lives. Tom's pursuit of past glories hints at dissatisfaction beneath the surface.\r\n* **Masculinity and Power:** Tom's physical presence, assertive voice, and manner project dominance. His need to assert himself (even subtly) creates an undercurrent of tension.\r\n* **Passivity vs. Action:** The contrasting images of the windswept environment and the motionless women on the divan suggest a dichotomy –  external movement versus internal stillness, hinting at societal roles and constraints.\r\n* **Hidden Depths:** Nick's observant narration implies that appearances conceal much.  The true nature of relationships (Tom/Daisy, Tom/Nick) and their motivations remain to be fully explored. \r\n\r\n**Overall Impression:** The passage sets a stage rich in symbolism and foreshadowing, promising a narrative delving into the complexities of wealth, masculinity, and the facade of perfection in the Jazz Age.",

Daisy was my second cousin once\nremoved, and I’d known Tom in college. And just af-\nter the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\nHer husband, among various physical accomplish-\nments, had been one of the most powerful ends that\never played football at New Haven—a national fig-\nure in a way, one of those men who reach such an\nacute limited excellence at twenty-one that every-\nthing afterward savors of anti-climax. His family\nwere enormously wealthy—even in college his free-\ndom with money was a matter for reproach—but\nnow he’d left Chicago and come East in a fashion\nthat rather took your breath away: for instance,\nhe’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\nForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my\nown generation was wealthy enough to do that.\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had\nspent a year in France for no particular reason, and\nthen drifted here and there unrestfully wherever\npeople played polo and were rich together. This\nwas a permanent move, said Daisy over the tele-\nphone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into\nDaisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on\nforever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic\nturbulence of some irrecoverable football game.\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy eve-\n\n8 THE GREAT GATSBY\nning I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends\nwhom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even\nmore elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-\nwhite Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the\nbay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward\nthe front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over\nsun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—\nfinally when it reached the house drifting up the\nside in bright vines as though from the momentum\nof its run. The front was broken bya line of French\nwindows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide\nopen to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Bu-\nchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs\napart on the front porch.\nHe had changed since his New Haven years.\nNow he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty\nwith a rather hard mouth and a supercilious man-\nner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\ndominance over his face and gave him the appear-\nance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could\nhide the enormous power of that body—he seemed\nto fill those glistening boots until he strained the\ntop lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin\ncoat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage\n—a cruel body.\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to\nthe impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 9\nwas a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward\npeople he liked—and there were men at New Haven\nwho had hated his guts.\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters\nis final,” he seemed to say, “just because ’m\nstronger and more of a man than you are.” We\nwere in the same senior society, and while we were\nnever intimate I always had the impression that he\napproved of me and wanted me to like him with\nsome harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\n“T’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes\nflashing about restlessly.\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a\nbroad flat hand along the front vista, including in\nits sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of\ndeep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat\nthat bumped the tide offshore.\n“Tt belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned\nme around again, politely and abruptly. “‘We’ll go\ninside.”\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright\nrosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by\nFrench windows at either end. The windows were\najar and gleaming white against the fresh grass\noutside that seemed to grow a little way into the\nhouse. A breeze blew through the room, blew cur-\ntains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,\ntwisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake\n\n10 THE GREAT GATSBY\nof the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-\ncolored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does\non the sea.\nThe only completely stationary object in the\nroom was an enormous couch on which two young\nwomen were buoyed up as though upon an anchored\nballoon. They were both in white, and their dresses\nwere rippling and fluttering as if they had just been\nblown back in after a short flight around the house.\nI must have stood for a few moments listening to\nthe whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of\na picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as\nTom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the\ncaught wind died out about the room, and the cur-\ntains and the rugs and the two young women bal-\nlooned slowly to the floor.\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me.\nShe was extended full length at her end of the\ndivan, completely motionless\n######################\nOutput:"

In-\nstead of being the warm centre of the world, the\nMiddle West now seemed like the ragged edge of\nthe universe—so I decided to go East and learn the\nbond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond\nbusiness, so I supposed it could support one more\n\n4 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsingle man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over\nas if they were choosing a prep school for me, and\nfinally said, ‘‘Why—ye-es,”’ with very grave, hesi-\ntant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year,\nand after various delays I came East, permanently,\nI thought, in the spring of twenty-two.\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city,\nbut it was a warm season, and I had just left a\ncountry of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when\na young man at the office suggested that we take a\nhouse together in a commuting town, it sounded\nlike a great idea. He found the house, a weather-\nbeaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but\nat the last minute the firm ordered him to Wash-\nington, and I went out to the country alone. I had\na dog—at least I had him for a few days until he\nran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman,\nwho made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut-\ntered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric\nstove.\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning\nsome man, more recently arrived than I, stopped\nme on the road.\n“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked\nhelplessly.\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no\nlonger. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original set-\ntler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom\nof the neighborhood.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 5\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of\nleaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in\nfast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life\nwas beginning over again with the summer.\nThere was so much to read, for one thing, and so\nmuch fine health to be pulled down out of the young\nbreath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on\nbanking and credit and investment securities, and\nthey stood on my shelf in red and gold like new\nmoney from the mint, promising to unfold the shin-\ning secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Me-\ncenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading\nmany other books besides. I was rather literary in\ncollege—one year I wrote a series of very solemn\nand obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now\nI was going to bring back all such things into my\nlife and become again that most limited of all\nspecialists, the ‘well-rounded man.” This isn’t just\nan epigram—life is much more successfully looked\nat from a single window, after all.\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have\nrented a house in one of the strangest communities\nin North America. It was on that slender riotous\nisland which extends itself due east of New York\n—and where there are, among other natural curi-\nosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty\nmiles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identi-\ncal in contour and separated only by a courtesy\nbay, jut out into the most domesticated body of\n\n6 THE GREAT GATSBY\nsalt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet\nbarnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not per-\nfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they\nare both crushed flat at the contact end—but their\nphysical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\nwonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wing-\nless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimi-\nlarity in every particular except shape and size.\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashion-\nable of the two, though this is a most superficial\ntag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister\ncontrast between them. My house was at the very\ntip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and\nsqueezed between two huge places that rented for\ntwelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my\nright was a colossal affair by any standard—it was\na factual imitation of some Hétel de Ville in Nor-\nmandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new\nunder a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swim-\nming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and\ngarden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I\ndidn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited\nby a gentleman of that name. My own house was\nan eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had\nbeen overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a\npartial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the con-\nsoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dol-\nlars a month.\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 7\nfashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and\nthe history of the summer really begins on the eve-\nning I drove over there to have dinner with the\nTom Buchanans.

Represents a controlling force.\r\n* **Mrs. Wilson (Myrtle's Sister):**  Mentioned briefly, Myrtle mentions visiting her in New York.\r\n* **Nick Carraway (Narrator):** Observant outsider, witnessing the unfolding drama, highlighting the chaotic atmosphere and societal dynamics.\r\n* **Mr. McKee & Mrs. McKee:** Present at the gathering, adding to the ambiance of revelry and unease.\r\n* **Daisy (Indirectly):**  Central to the conflict between Tom and Mrs. Wilson, her name becomes a trigger point.\r\n\r\n**Key Events & Themes:**\r\n\r\n1. **Myrtle's Marriage Narrative:** The core is Myrtle recounting her ill-fated marriage to Tom, marked by deceit (borrowed suit), immediate regret, and feeling trapped (\"living over the garage\" for years).\r\n2. **Passion & Control:**  Tom's outburst against Mrs. Wilson, breaking her nose, showcases his possessiveness and violence used to control narratives (Daisy's name). \r\n3. **Social Decay & Superficiality:**  The party atmosphere with excessive drinking, fleeting conversations, and emphasis on material possessions (\"massage, wave, ash-tray\") paints a picture of hollow revelry masking deeper issues.\r\n4. **Entangled Narratives:** Nick's position allows him to piece together fragmented conversations and actions, emphasizing the interconnectedness (and often chaotic) nature of their lives.\r\n5. **Rising Tension:** The escalating argument about Daisy foreshadows a significant plot point, hinting at a web of secrets and complications tied to her. \r\n\r\n**Emerging Plot Threads:**\r\n* **Daisy's Role:** While absent, her name holds power, revealing a love triangle or past entanglement crucial to understanding the conflict.\r\n* **Myrtle's Vulnerability:** Her story highlights her subjugation within the marriage and foreshadows potential tragic consequences.\r\n* **Tom's Dark Side:** His violence reveals a character capable of ruthlessness and controlling behavior, setting the stage for further dramatic developments. \r\n\r\nThis analysis lays groundwork for understanding the unfolding narrative in *The Great Gatsby* through the lens of this specific passage.",

Highlights a breach of marital trust.\r\n* **Telephone Calls:** Symbolic of disruption and secrecy. The insistent ringing emphasizes the weight of unspoken issues.\r\n* **Stables (mentioned but sidelined):**  Initially a planned outing by Tom, now forgotten due to the prevailing drama, signifying normalcy being overshadowed.\r\n* **\"Nightingale\" Metaphor (Daisy):** Romantic imagery used by Daisy possibly as a deflection or subconscious yearning for innocence amidst complexity.\r\n* **Cousins (Daisy & Nick):**  A familial link forsøken to downplay despite their distance and lack of closeness.\r\n\r\n**Narrative Threads & Tone:**\r\n* **Hidden Truths & Deception:**  The passage thrives on what's *not* explicitly stated. Whispered conversations, averted gazes, and implied affairs create a sense of mounting suspense.\r\n* **Social Dissonance:** A facade of polite conversation masks deep-seated unease and secrets within the seemingly glamorous setting. \r\n* **Nick's Perspective:**  His outsider status allows him to  piece together fragments, mirroring the reader's experience of gradual revelation. The tone leans towards cautious observation and growing intrigue. \n\n\n**In essence, this excerpt sets the stage for a story driven by concealed desires, fractured relationships, and the unraveling of a seemingly idyllic facade.**",

She was only extemporizing, but a stirring\nwarmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying\nto come out to you concealed in one of those breath-\nless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her\nnapkin on the table and excused herself and went\ninto the house.\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance con-\nsciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak\nwhen she sat up alertly and said “Sh!” in a warn-\ning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was\naudible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned\nforward unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur\ntrembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,\nmounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor—”\nI began.\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n“Ts something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss\nBaker, honestly surprised. “I thought everybody\nknew.”\n“T don’t.”\n““Why—” she said hesitantly, ‘“Tom’s got some\nwoman in New York.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 19\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\nMiss Baker nodded.\n“She might have the decency not to telephone\nhim at dinner time. Don’t you think?”\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there\nwas the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather\nboots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the\ntable.\n“Tt couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense\ngayety.\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker\nand then at me, and continued: “TI looked outdoors\nfor a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors.\nThere’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a\nnightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star\nLine. He’s singing away—” Her voice sang: “It’s\nromantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to\nme: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to\ntake you down to the stables.”\nThe telephone rang inside, startingly, and as\nDaisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject\nof the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air.\nAmong the broken fragments of the last five minutes\nat table I remember the candles being lit again,\npointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look\nsquarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. I\ncouldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking,\nbut I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have\n\n20 THE GREAT GATSBY\nmastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able ut-\nterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic ur-\ngency out of mind. To a certain temperament the\nsituation might have seemed intriguing—my own\ninstinct was to telephone immediately for the\npolice.\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned\nagain. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of\ntwilight between them, strolled back into the library,\nas if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\ntrying to look pleasantly interested anda little deaf,\nI followed Daisy around a chain of connecting ver-\nandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we\nsat down side by side on a wicker settee.\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its\nlovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out\ninto the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions\npossessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\nsome sedative questions about her little girl.\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,”’ she\nsaid suddenly. ‘‘Even if we are cousins. You didn’t\ncome to my wedding.”\n“‘T wasn’t back from the war.”\n““That’s true.”\n######################\nOutput:"

One of them I call ‘Montauk\nPoint—The Gulls,’ and the other I call ‘Montauk\nPoint—The Sea.’”\nThe sister Catherine sat down beside me on the\ncouch.\n“Do you live down on Long Island, too,” she in-\nquired.\n“T live at West Egg.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 39\n“Really?

When I was here\nlast I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me\nmy name and address—inside of a week I got a\npackage from Croirier’s with a new evening gown\nin it.”\n“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n“Sure I did.

The three Mr.\nMumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.\n“T don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille\nsceptically; “it’s more that he was a German spy\nduring the war.”\nOne of the men nodded in confirmation.\n“TY heard that from a man who knew all about\nhim, grew up with him in Germany,” he assured us\npositively.\n“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “‘it couldn’t be that,\nbecause he was in the American army during the\nwar.” As our credulity switched back to her she\nleaned forward with enthusiasm. ‘You look at him\nsometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him.\nVl bet he killed a man.”\nShe narrowed her eyes and shivered.

Instead of\nrambling this party had preserved a dignified homo-\ngeneity, and assumed to itself the function of rep-\nresenting the staid nobility of the country-side—\nEast Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully\non guard against its spectroscopic gayety.\n“Tet’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a some-\nhow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is\nmuch too polite for me.”\nWe got up, and she explained that we were going\nto find the host: I had never met him, she said, and\nit was making me uneasy. The undergraduate\nnodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\nThe bar, where we glanced first, was crowded,\nbut Gatsby was not there. She couldn’t find him\nfrom the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the\nveranda.

As a matter of fact you needn’t\nbother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”\n“The books?”\nHe nodded.\n“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I\nthought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter\nof fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and— Here!\nLemme show you.”\nTaking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to\nthe bookcases and returned with Volume One of the\n“Stoddard Lectures.”\n“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide\npiece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s\na regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thorough-\nness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too—\ndidn’t cut the pages. But what do you want?\nWhat do you expect?”\nHe snatched the book from me and replaced it\nhastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was\nremoved the whole library was liable to collapse.\n\n56 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you\njust come? I was brought. Most people were\nbrought.”\nJordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without\nanswering.\n“TY was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,”\nhe continued. “Mrs. Claud Roosevelt.

He feels a sense of awe and slight confusion regarding Daisy's captivating aura and Miss Baker's enigmatic actions.\r\n* **Daisy Buchanan (Central Figure, Alluring & Complex):**  Charming, emotionally expressive, hints at a past filled with excitement (\"gay, exciting things\"). Possesses a magnetic quality that draws attention and fuels speculation. Her voice is described as alluring and hinting at hidden depths.\r\n* **Tom Buchanan (Powerful, Aloof):** Daisy's husband, appears dominant and restless. Shows disinterest in Nick's profession initially but asserts his permanence in the East, emphasizing his societal standing. \r\n* **Miss Baker (Mysterious & Witty):**  Initially silent and seemingly balanced (both literally and metaphorically), she suddenly interjects with surprising directness.  Her aloof demeanor contrasts with Daisy's openness, adding an element of intrigue. Described as slender, with a sharp intellect and a touch of cynicism (\"contemptuously\" about West Egg).\r\n\r\n**Relationships & Dynamics:**\r\n\r\n* **Daisy & Nick:** A clear attraction and fascination from Nick towards Daisy's captivating personality. Their conversation reveals a closeness built on shared experiences and implied secrets.\r\n* **Daisy & Tom:**  A complex marriage hinted at through their interactions. Tom appears possessive and in control, while Daisy expresses longing for a different life (\"go back to...tomorrow!\"). \r\n* **Miss Baker & Social Circle:**  She holds a unique position, observant yet detached. Her comment about West Egg suggests knowledge and perhaps subtle judgment within this elite social circle.\r\n* **Narrator's Role (Nick):** Acts as a lens through which we perceive these relationships, highlighting the complexities and unspoken currents flowing beneath the surface glamour. \r\n\r\n**Themes Emerging:**\r\n    * **Social Dynamics & Appearances:** The lavish setting and carefully crafted personas reveal a society obsessed with image and hidden truths.\r\n    * **Feminine Allure & Power:** Both Daisy and Miss Baker, though different in expression, wield a captivating influence within this male-dominated world.\r\n    * **Longing & Escapism:**  Hints of dissatisfaction and a desire for something more genuine underlie the superficiality.\r\n    * **Observation & Interpretation:** Nick's role as narrator emphasizes the novel's exploration of understanding human behavior through subtle cues and interactions. \n\n\n**Further Analysis (Based on Context):**\r\nThe passage sets the stage for exploring  contrasts and tensions within the \"Jazz Age\" society. While glamour and wealth are apparent,  undercurrents of restlessness, yearning, and unspoken desires simmer beneath. Miss Baker's sudden entrance and enigmatic remarks foreshadow her potential as a disruptor to established norms and perceptions within this social fabric. Her connection to West Egg adds another layer of intrigue, hinting at possible alternative narratives or viewpoints existing outside the immediate circle.  Nick, as our guide, is poised to unravel these complexities further.",

That was a\nway she had. She hinted in a murmur that the sur-\nname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard\nit said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made\nit no less charming.)\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nod-\nded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly\ntipped her head back again—the object she was bal-\nancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\nsomething of a fright.

Almost any exhibition of complete\nself-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me\nquestions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the\nkind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as\nif each speech is an arrangement of notes that will\nnever be played again. Her face was sad and lovely\nwith bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright\npassionate mouth, but there was an excitement in\nher voice that men who had cared for her found\ndifficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered\n“Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, excit-\ning things just a while since and that there were\ngay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.\n\n12 THE GREAT GATSBY\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a\nday on my way East, and how a dozen people had\nsent their love through me.\n“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.\n“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have\nthe left rear wheel painted black as a mourning\nwreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along\nthe north shore.”\n“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom.

She was\na slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect car-\nriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body\nbackward at the shoulders like a young cadet.\nHer gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with\npolite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charm-\ning, discontented face.

J. Eckleburg:**  Central symbol -  giant, detached eyes overlooking the wasteland. Represent absent divinity, societal scrutiny, or the lingering gaze of the past on a corrupted present.\r\n* **Ash:** Metaphor for the hollowness, decay, and remnants of broken dreams in the industrialized society.\r\n* **Gray Cars & Leaden Spades:** Tools of labor within the ash landscape, emphasizing repetitive, meaningless work.\r\n* **Green Light (Mentioned Earlier):**  While not directly in this excerpt, its symbolism (hope, longing, Gatsby's yearning) connects to the overarching themes and foreshadowing.\r\n\r\n**Relationships & Atmosphere:**\r\n* **Contrast & Juxtaposition:**  Constant comparison between West Egg's affluence and the Valley of Ashes' despair creates a thematic tension.\r\n* **Isolation & Observance:** Nick's role as an observer emphasizes the alienation and detachment within this decaying society.\r\n* **Symbolic Gaze:** Doctor Eckleburg's eyes suggest a silent judgment or awareness of the moral decay unfolding in the valley.\r\n* **Foreboding & Mystery:**  The vanishing figure of Gatsby and the lingering sense of unease foreshadow deeper complexities to come. \r\n\r\nThis analysis highlights the rich thematic and symbolic groundwork laid in this excerpt, setting the stage for *The Great Gatsby*'s exploration of American society, dreams, and disillusionment.",

A momentary\nhush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm oblig-\ningly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the\nerroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s\nunderstudy from the Follies. The party has begun.\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gats-\nby’s house I was one of the few guests who had\nactually been invited. People were not invited—\nthey went there. They got into automobiles which\nbore them out to Long Island, and somehow they\nended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were\nintroduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and\nafter that they conducted themselves according to\n\n50 THE GREAT GATSBY\nthe rules of behavior associated with an amusement\npark. Sometimes they came and went without hav-\ning met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a\nsimplicity of heart that was its own ticket of ad-\nmission.\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a\nuniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early\nthat Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal\nnote from his employer: the honor would be entirely\nGatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party”\nthat night. He had seen me several times, and had\nintended to call on me long before, but a peculiar\ncombination of circumstances had prevented it—\nsigned Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his\nlawn a little after seven, and wandered around\nrather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people\nI didn’t know—though here and there was a face\nI had noticed on the commuting train. I was im-\nmediately struck by the number of young English-\nmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a\nlittle hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices\nto solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that\nthey were selling something: bonds or insurance or\nautomobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware\nof the easy money in the vicinity and convinced\nthat it was theirs for a few words in the right\nkey.\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 51\nmy host, but the two or three people of whom I\nasked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\namazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowl-\nedge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direc-\ntion of the cocktail table—the only place in the\ngarden where a single man could linger without\nlooking purposeless and alone.\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer\nembarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the\nhouse and stood at the head of the marble steps,\nleaning a little backward and looking with contemp-\ntuous interest down into the garden.\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach\nmyself to some one before I should begin to address\ncordial remarks to the passers-by.\n“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My\nvoice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\n“T thought you might be here,” she responded\nabsently as I came up. “I remembered you lived\nnext door to——”’\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that\nshe’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to\ntwo girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at\nthe foot of the steps.\n“Hello!” they cried together. ‘Sorry you didn’t\nwin.”\nThat was for the golf tournament. She had lost\nin the finals the week before.\n“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the\n\n52 THE GREAT GATSBY\ngirls in yellow, “but we met you here about a\nmonth ago.”\n“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked\nJordan, and I started, but the girls had moved\ncasually on and her remark was addressed to the pre-\nmature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out\nof a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden\narm resting in mine, we descended the steps and\nsauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails\nfloated at us through the twilight, and we sat down\nat a table with the two girls in yellow and three\nmen, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired\nJordan of the girl beside her.\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” an-\nswered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She\nturned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you,\nLucille?”\nIt was for Lucille, too.\n“T like to come,”’ Lucille said. ‘I never care what\nI do, so I always have a good time.

Evidently some wild wag of an\noculist set them there to fatten his practice in the\n27\n\n28 THE GREAT GATSBY\nborough of Queens, and then sank down himself\ninto eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved\naway.

There is always a halt there of at\nleast a minute, and it was because of this that I\nfirst met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon\nwherever he was known. His acquaintances re-\nsented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés\nwith her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered\nabout, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though\nI was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her\n—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\nthe train one afternoon, and when we stopped by\nthe ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold\nof my elbow, literally forced me from the car.\n“We're getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to\nmeet my girl.”\nI think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and\nhis determination to have my company bordered\non violence. The supercilious assumption was that\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\nI followed him over a low whitewashed railroad\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 29\nfence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the\nroad under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The\nonly building in sight was a small block of yellow\nbrick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of\ncompact Main Street ministering to it, and contigu-\nous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it\ncontained was for rent and another was an all-night\nrestaurant, approached bya t rail of ashes; the third\nwas a garage—Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars\nbought and sold.—and I followed Tom inside.\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only\ncar visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford\nwhich crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to\nme that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and\nthat sumptuous and romantic apartments were con-\ncealed overhead, when the proprietor himself ap-\npeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\non a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man,\nanemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us\na damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue\neyes.\n“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping\nhim jovially on the shoulder. ‘‘How’s business?”\n“T can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvinc-\ningly. ‘When are you going to sell me that car?”\n“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it\nnow.”\n“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”\n““No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. ‘‘And if you\n\n30 THE GREAT GATSBY\nfeel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it some-\nwhere else after all.”\n“T don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly.\n“T just meant——”\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently\naround the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a\nstairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a\nwoman blocked out the light from the office door.\nShe was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but\nshe carried her flesh sensuously as some women can.\nHer face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crépe-\nde-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty,\nbut there was an immediately perceptible vitality\nabout her as if the nerves of her body were continu-\nally smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking\nthrough her husband as if he were a ghost, shook\nhands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.\nThen she wet her lips, and without turning around\nspoke to her husband ina soft, coarse voice:\n““Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody\ncan sit down.”\n“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went\ntoward the little office, mingling immediately with\nthe cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust\nveiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled\neverything in the vicinity—except his wife, who\nmoved close to Tom.\n“‘T want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on\nthe next train.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 31\n“All right.”\n“T’ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower\nlevel.”\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as\nGeorge Wilson emerged with two chairs from his\noffice door.\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight.\nIt was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a\ngray, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in\na row along the railroad track\n######################\nOutput:"

The only picture was an\nover-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting\non a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance, how-\never, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the\ncountenance of a stout old lady beamed down into\nthe room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on\nthe table together with a copy of “Simon Called\nPeter,”’ and some of the small scandal magazines of\nBroadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box\nfull of straw and some milk, to which he added on\nhis own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits—\none of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out\na bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.\nI have been drunk just twice in my life, and the\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 35\nsecond time was that afternoon; so everything that\nhappened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although\nuntil after eight o’clock the apartment was full of\ncheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson\ncalled up several people on the telephone; then there\nwere no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at\nthe drugstore on the corner. When I came back\nthey had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly\nin the living-room and read a chapter of “Simon\nCalled Peter”—either it was terrible stuff or the\nwhiskey distorted things, because it didn’t make\nany sense to me.\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs.\nWilson and I called each other by our first names)\nreappeared, company commenced to arrive at the\napartment-door.\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl\nof about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair,\nand a complexion powdered milky white. Her eye-\nbrows had been plucked and then drawn on again\nat a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature\ntoward the restoration of the old alignment gave a\nblurred air to her face. When she moved about\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pot-\ntery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.\nShe came in with such a proprietary haste, and\nlooked around so possessively at the furniture that\nI wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her\nshe laughed immoderately, repeated my question\n\n36 THE GREAT GATSBY\naloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a\nhotel.\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the\nflat below. He had just shaved, for there was a\nwhite spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was\nmost respectful in his greeting to every one in the\nroom. He informed me that he was in the “‘artistic\ngame,” and I gathered later that he was a photog-\nrapher and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\nWilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm\non the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome,\nand horrible. She told me with pride that her hus-\nband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-\nseven times since they had been married.\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time\nbefore, and was now attired in an elaborate after-\nnoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out\na continual rustle as she swept about the room.\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had\nalso undergone a change. The intense vitality that\nhad been so remarkable in the garage was converted\ninto impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures,\nher assertions became more violently affected mo-\nment by moment, and as she expanded the room\ngrew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the\nsmoky air.\n““My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing\nshout, ‘‘most of these fellas will cheat you every\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 37\ntime. All they think of is money. I had a woman\nup here last week to look at my feet, and when she\ngave me the bill you’d of thought she had my\nappendicitus out.”\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs.\nMcKee.\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at\npeople’s feet in their own homes.”\n“T like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, ‘‘I\nthink it’s adorable.”\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising\nher eyebrow in disdain.\n“Tt’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip\nit on sometimes when I don’t care what I look\nlike.”\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know\nwhat I mean,” pursued Mrs. McKee. “If Chester\ncould only get you in that pose I think he could\nmake something of it.”\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who re-\nmoved a strand of hair from over her eyes and\nlooked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee\nregarded her intently with his head on one side,\nand then moved his hand back and forth slowly in\nfront of his face.\n“T should change the light,” he said after a mo-\nment. ‘‘I’d like to bring out the modelling of the\nfeatures. And I’d try to get hold of all the back\nhair.”\n\n38 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried\n######################\nOutput:"

A cele-\nbrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious\ncontralto had sung in jazz, and between the num-\nbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,\nwhile happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 57\nthe summer sky. A pair of stage twins, who turned\nout to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in cos-\ntume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger\nthan finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and\nfloating in the Sound was at riangle of silver scales,\ntrembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the\nbanjoes on the lawn.\nI was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at\na table with a man of about my age and a rowdy\nlittle girl, who gave way upon the slightest provo-\ncation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying\nmyself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of cham-\npagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes\ninto something significant, elemental, and profound.\nAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at\nme and smiled.\n“Your face is familiar,”’ he said, politely. “‘Weren’t\nyou in the First Division during the war?”\n“Why, yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infan-\ntry.”\n“J was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-\neighteen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.”\nWe talked for a moment about some wet, gray\nlittle villages in France. Evidently he lived in this\nvicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a\nhydroplane, and was going to try it out in the\nmorning.\n“‘Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the\nshore along the Sound.”\n\n58 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“What time?”\n‘Any time that suits you best.”\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name\nwhen Jordan looked around and smiled.\n“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n“Much better.” I turned again to my new ac-\nquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I\nhaven’t even seen the host. I live over there—”’\nI waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the dis-\ntance, ‘‘and this man Gatsby sent over his chauf-\nfeur with an invitation.”\nFor a moment he looked at me as if he failed to\nunderstand.\n“T’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n“What!” I exclaimed. ‘“‘Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n“T thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid ’'m\nnot a very good host.”\nHe smiled understandingly—much more than un-\nderstandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with\na quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may\ncome across four or five times in life. It faced—or\nseemed to face—the whole eternal world for an in-\nstant, and then concentrated on you with_an irresis-\ntible prejudice in your favor.

Some time before he introduced him-\nself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking\nhis words with care.\nAlmost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified\nhimself a butler hurried toward him with the infor-\nmation that Chicago was calling him on the wire.\nHe excused himself with a small bow that included\neach of us in turn.\n“Tf you want anything just ask for it, old sport,”\nhe urged me. “‘Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”\nWhen he was gone I turned immediately to Jor-\ndan—constrained to assure her of my surprise. I\nhad expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and\ncorpulent person in his middle years.\n“Who is he?’”’ I demanded. “Do you know?”\n“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n“Where is he from, I mean?

I won-\ndered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to\nset him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that\nhe grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity in-\ncreased. When the ‘‘Jazz History of the World” was\nover, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoul-\nders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swoon-\ning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into\ngroups, knowing that some one would arrest their\nfalls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby,\nand no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and\nno singing quartets were formed for Gatsby’s head\nfor one link.\n“T beg your pardon.”\nGatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon,\nbut Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.”\n“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.\n“Yes, madame.”\nShe got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in\nastonishment, and followed the butler toward the\nhouse. I noticed that she wore her evening-dress,\nall her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a\njauntiness about her movements as if she had first\nlearned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp\nmornings.\n\n62 THE GREAT GATSBY\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time\nconfused and intriguing sounds had issued from a\nlong, many-windowed room which overhung the\nterrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was\nnow engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two\nchorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I\nwent inside.\nThe large room was full of people. One of the\ngirls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside\nher stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a\nfamous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a\nquantity of champagne, and during the course of\nher song she had decided, ineptly, that everything\nwas very, very sad—she was not only singing, she\nwas weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in\nthe song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs,\nand then took up the lyric again in a quavering so-\nprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not\nfreely, however, for when they came into contact\nwith her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed\nan inky color, and pursued the rest of their way\nin slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was\nmade that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon\nshe threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went\noff into a deep vinous sleep.\n“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her\nhusband,” explained a girl at my elbow.\nTI looked around.

Forms leaned together in the taxis as\nthey waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter\nfrom unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made un-\nintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was\nhurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\nexcitement, I wished them well.\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then\nin midsummer I found her again. At first I was\nflattered to go places with her, because she was a\ngolf champion, and every one knew her name.\nThen it was something more. I wasn’t actually in\nlove, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The pored\nhaughty face that she turned to the world concealed\nsomething—most affectations conceal something\neventually, even though they don’t in the beginning\n—and one day I found what it was. When we were\non a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\nborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and\nthen lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the\nstory about her that had eluded me that night at\nDaisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers—a sugges-\ntion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in\nthe semi-final round. The thing approached the\nproportions of a scandal—then died away. A\ncaddy retracted his statement, and the only other\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 71\nwitness admitted that he might have been mis-\ntaken. The incident and the name had remained\ntogether in my mind.\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd\nmen, and now I saw that this was because she felt\nsafer on a plane where any divergence from a code\nwould be thought impossible. She was incurably\ndishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a\ndisadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I sup-\npose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent\nsmile turned to the world and yet satisfy the de-\nmands of her hard, jaunty body.\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a\nwoman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was\ncasually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\nsame house party that we had a curious conversa-\ntion about driving a car. It started because she\npassed so close to some workmen that our fender\nflicked a button on one man’s coat.\n“You're a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you\nought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive\nat all.”\n“T am careful.”\n“No, you’re not.”\n‘Well, other people are,”’ she said lightly.\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\n“They'll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It\ntakes two to make an accident.”\n\n72 THE GREAT GATSBY\n‘“‘Suppose you met somebody just as careless as\nyourself.”\n“T hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate care-\nless people. That’s why I like you.”\nHer gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead,\nbut she had deliberately shifted our relations, and\nfor a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-\nthinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get\nmyself definitely out of that tangle back home.\nI'd been writing letters once a week and signing\nthem: ‘Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was\nhow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint\nmustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip.\nNevertheless there was a vague understanding that\nhad to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the\ncardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the\nfew honest people that I have ever known.\n\nCHAPTER IV\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the\nvillages alongshore, the world and its mistress re-\nturned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously\non his lawn.\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, mov-\ning somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.\n“‘One time he killed a man who had found out that\nhe was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second\ncousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and\npour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.”\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-\ntable the names of those who came to Gatsby’s\nhouse that summer. It is an old time-table now, dis-\nintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule\nin effect July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the\ngray names, and they will give you a better impres-\nsion than my generalities of those who accepted\nGatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute\nof knowing nothing whatever about him.\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers\nand the\n######################\nOutput:"

This quality was continually breaking\nthrough his punctilious manner in the shape of rest-\nlessness. He was never quite still; there was always\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 77\na tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening\nand closing of a hand.\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\n“Tt’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off\nto give me a better view. “‘Haven’t you ever seen\nit before?”\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich\ncream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and\nthere in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-\nboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and ter-\nraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored\na dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of\nglass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we\nstarted to town.\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times\nin the past month and found, to my disappointment,\nthat he had little to say. So my first impression, that\nhe was a person of some undefined consequence, had\ngradually faded and he had become simply the pro-\nprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We\nhadn’t reached West Egg Village before Gatsby\nbegan leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and\nslapping himself indecisively on the knee of his\ncaramel-colored suit.\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly,\n“‘what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized eva-\nsions which that question deserves.\n\n78 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my\nlife,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a\nwrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that\nflavored conversation in his halls.\n“T’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand sud-\ndenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “TI\nam the son of some wealthy people in the Middle\nWest—all dead now. I was brought up in America\nbut educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors\nhave been educated there for many years. It is a\nfamily tradition.”\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jor-\ndan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried\nthe phrase ‘educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it,\nor choked on it, as though it had bothered him be-\nfore. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell\nto pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something\na little sinister about him, after all.\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired\ncasually.\n“San Francisco.”\n“T see.”\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal\nof money.”\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that\nsudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For\na moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg,\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 79\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the\ncapitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collect-\ning jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, paint-\ning a little, things for myself only, and trying to\nforget something very sad that had happened to me\nlong ago.”\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredu-\nlous laughter. The very phrases were worn so\nthreadbare that they evoked no image except that\nof a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every\npore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de\nBoulogne.\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great\nrelief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to\nbear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission\nas first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne\nForest I took the remains of my machine-gun bat-\ntalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap\non either side of us where the infantry couldn’t\nadvance.

      "return": "##  Gatsby's Guest List and Social Dynamics (Analysis from Text)\r\n\r\nThis passage from *The Great Gatsby* masterfully  establishes a **who's who of the Roaring Twenties elite**, highlighting their eccentricities and interwoven connections within Gatsby's extravagant world. Here's a breakdown based on extracted information and thematic implications:\r\n\r\n**1. Categorization and Origins:**\r\n   * **East Egg & West Egg Residents:**  The primary division reflects social strata even within wealth. East Egg implies old money, established families (Cheadles, Dancies, Auerbachs, etc.), while West Egg hints at newer fortunes and ambition (Mulreadys, Film industry folks like Orchid). Gatsby himself bridges this divide with his lavish parties attracting both.\r\n   * **NYC Influx:**  A significant portion hail from New York City (Chromes, Backhyssons, etc.), showcasing Gatsby's reach across social circles and the convergence of glamour in the metropolis.\r\n   * **Thematic Groups:**  Unofficial categories emerge: \"theatrical people,\" those connected to movies/entertainment, gamblers/speculators (Ferret, Associated Traction), and even  individuals with peculiar histories (like Snell's accident or  Henry Palmetto's suicide).\r\n\r\n**2.  Personality & Remarkable Details:**\r\n   * **Eccentricities Emphasized:**  Descriptions like Edgar Beaver's sudden white hair, Klipspringer (\"the boarder\"), and Benny McClenahan's interchangeable girl companions add color and  a sense of the absurd prevalent in this era.\r\n   * **Names as Indicators:**  Melodic flower/capitalist names for the girls, \"Duke\" for the prince, underscore the performative nature of identity and social climbing.\r\n\r\n**3.  Social Dynamics & Gatsby's Influence:**\r\n   * **Networked Existence:**  Interconnections are abundant (cousins, shared acquaintances, professional links). Gatsby's parties become focal points, drawing in diverse individuals.\r\n   * **American Exceptionalism:** Gatsby's \"resourcefulness\" and the American style emphasized highlight a culture of mobility, self-made success, and a certain nonchalance towards traditional norms.\r\n   * **Power & Invitation:** Gatsby directly invites the narrator, showcasing his desire to control the narrative and weave himself into established social circles. His wealth acts as a magnet, but the *choice* to attend speaks volumes about status and perception.\r\n\r\n**In Conclusion:** This passage is more than a guest list; it's a snapshot of the Jazz Age's complexities:  opulence, fleeting connections, performative identities, and the allure (and perhaps illusion) of Gatsby's world. It sets the stage for exploring themes of class, ambition, and the elusive American Dream within the novel's narrative.",

Snell was there three\ndays before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk\nout on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s\nautomobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies\ncame, too, and S. B.

No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby\nhesitated, then added coolly: “‘He’s the man who\nfixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”\n“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\nThe idea staggered me. I remembered, of course,\nthat the World’s Series had been fixed in 1910, but if\nI had thought of it at all I would have thought of it\nas a thing that merely happened, the end of some in-\nevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one\nman could start to play with the faith of fifty mil-\nlion people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar\nblowing a safe.\n“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after\na minute.\n“‘He just saw the opportunity.”\n“Why isn’t he in jail?”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 89\n“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart\nman.”\nI insisted on paying the check. As the waiter\nbrought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan\nacross the crowded room.\n“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve\ngot to say hello to some one.”\nWhen he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a\ndozen steps in our direction.\n““Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly.\n‘‘Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.”\n“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”\nThey shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfa-\nmiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s\nface.\n“‘How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of\nme. “How’d you happen to come up this far to\neat?”\n“T’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”\nI turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer\nthere.\nOne October day in nineteen-seventeen——\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very\nstraight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the\nPlaza Hotel)\n—TI was walking along from one place to another, half\non the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was hap-\n\ngo THE GREAT GATSBY\npier on the lawns because I had on shoes from\nEngland with rubber nobs on the soles that bit\ninto the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt\nalso that blew a little in the wind, and whenever\nthis happened the red, white, and blue banners in\nfront of all the houses stretched out stiff and said\ntut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the\nlawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just\neighteen, two years older than me, and by far the\nmost popular of all the young girls in Louisville.\nShe dressed in white, and had al ittle white roadster,\nand all day long the telephone rang in her house and\nexcited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded\nthe privilege of monopolizing her that night. “‘ Any-\nways, for an hour!”\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning\nher white roadster was beside the curb, and she was\nsitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before.\nThey were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t\nsee me until I was five feet away.\n“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. ‘\n######################\nOutput:"

Unlike Gatsby\nand Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied\nface floated along the dark cornices and blinding\nsigns, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tighten-\ning my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and\nso I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.\n\nCHAPTER V\nWHEN I came home to West Egg that night I was\nafraid for a moment that my house was on fire.\nTwo o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula\nwas blazing with light, which fell unreal on the\nshrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the\nroadside wires. Turning a corner, I saw that it was\nGatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout\nthat had resolved itself into ‘“‘hide-and-go-seek”’\nor “sardines-in-the-box” with all the house thrown\nopen to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only\nwind in the trees, which blew the wires and made\nthe lights go off and on again as if the house had\nwinked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned\naway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his\nlawn.\n“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.\n“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently.\n‘‘T have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s\ngo to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.”\n“Tt’s too late.”\n‘Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-\npool? I haven’t made use of it all summer.”\n“T’ve got to go to bed.”\n98\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 99\n“All right.”\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eager-\nness.\n“T talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment.\n“T’m going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite\nher over here to tea.”\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t\nwant to put you to any trouble.”\n“What day would suit you?”\n“What day would suit you?” he corrected me\nquickly. ‘I don’t want to put you to any trouble,\nyou see.”\n“How about the day after to-morrow?”\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with re-\nluctance:\n“T want to get the grass cut,” he said.\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a\nsharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the\ndarker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected\nthat he meant my grass.\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncer-\ntainly, and hesitated.\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I\nasked.\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—”’’ He fumbled\nwith a series of beginnings. ‘Why, I thought—why,\nlook here, old sport, you don’t make much money,\ndo you?”\n“Not very much.”\n\n100 THE GREAT GATSBY\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued\nmore confidently.\n“T thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you\nsee, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of\nside line, you understand. And I thought that if\nyou don’t make very much— You’re selling bonds,\naren’t you, old sport?”\ncc Trying to.”\n“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take\nup much of your time and you might pick up a nice\nbit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential\nsort of thing.”\nI realize now that under different circumstances\nthat conversation might have been one of the crises\nof my life. But, because the offer was obviously\nand tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no\nchoice except to cut him off there.\n“Tve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much\nobliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with\nWolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shy-\ning away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at\nlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited\na moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation,\nbut I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\nunwillingly home.\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy;\nI think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my\nfront door. So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY IOI\nwent to Coney Island, or for how many hours he\n“glanced into rooms”’ while his house blazed gaudily\non. I called up Daisy from the office next morning,\nand invited her to come to tea.\n“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.\n“What?”\n“Don’t bring Tom.”\n“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.\nThe day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven\no’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower,\ntapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby\nhad sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded\nme that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come\nback, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for\nher among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock\na greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumer-\nable receptacles to contain it.

His grand gestures clash with Daisy's potential indifference, creating suspense about their reunion's outcome. \n\n\n**Continuing Analysis Points (For Deeper Dive):**\r\n* **Daisy's Agency:**  As the narrative progresses,  analyzing how much *choice* Daisy truly has within Gatsby's plan and societal expectations will be crucial.\r\n* **Symbolism & Setting:** Pay close attention to symbols like Gatsby's mansion, parties, and the changing park landscapes – they amplify thematic ideas about longing, illusion, and the American Dream.\r\n* **Jordan's Character Development:**  Exploring her cynicism further and how it interacts with Gatsby's romanticism will reveal deeper character dynamics.",

The girl who was with him got into the\npapers, too, because her arm was broken—she was\none of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara\nHotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they\nwent to France for a year. I saw them one spring\nin Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they\ncame back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was\npopular in Chicago, as you know. They moved\nwith a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and\nwild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect\nreputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s\n\n94 THE GREAT GATSBY\na great advantage not to drink among hard-drink-\ning people. You can hold your tongue, and, more-\nover, you can time any little irregularity of your\nown so that everybody else is so blind that they\ndon’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for\namour at all—and yet there’s something in that\nvoice of hers... .\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name\nGatsby for the first time in years. It was when I\nasked you—do you remember ?—if you knew Gatsby\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came\ninto my room and woke me up, and said: ‘‘What\nGatsby?” and when I described him—I was half\nasleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must\nbe the man she used to know. It wasn’t until then\nthat I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her\nwhite car.\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this\nwe had left the Plaza for half an hour and were\ndriving in a victoria through Central Park. The\nsun had gone down behind the tall apartments of\nthe movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear\nvoices of children, already gathered like crickets on\nthe grass, rose through the hot twilight:\n“T’m the Sheik of Araby.\nYour love belongs to me.\nAt night when you’re asleep\nInto your tent I’ll creep——”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 95\n“Tt was a strange coincidence,” I said.\n“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”\n“Why not?”\n“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would\nbe just across the bay.”\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which\nhe had aspired on that June night. He came alive\nto me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his\npurposeless splendor.\n“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “‘if you’ll\ninvite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then\nlet him come over.”\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had\nwaited five years and bought a mansion where he\ndispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he\ncould ‘‘come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s\ngarden.\n“Did I have to know all this before he could ask\nsuch al ittle thing?”\n“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought\nyou might be offended. You see, he’s regular tough\nunderneath it all.”\nSomething worried me.\n“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”\n“He wants her to see his house,” she explained.\n“‘And your house is right next door.”\nce Oh !9\n“T think he half expected her to wander into one\nof his parties, some night,’’ went on Jordan, ‘‘but\n\n96 THE GREAT GATSBY\nshe never did. Then he began asking people casually\nif they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and\nyou should have heard the elaborate way he worked\nup to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a\nluncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:\n“**T don’t want to do anything out of the way!’\nhe kept saying. ‘I want to see her right next door.’\n“‘When I said you were a particular friend of\nTom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea. He\ndoesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says\nhe’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the\nchance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under al ittle\nbridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoul-\nder and drew her toward me and asked her to din-\nner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and\nGatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited\nperson, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who\nleaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort\nof heady excitement: “‘There are only the pursued,\nthe pursuing, the busy and the tired.”\n‘And Daisy ought to have something in her life,”’\nmurmured Jordan to me.\n“Does she want to see Gatsby?”\n“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t\nwant her to know. You’re just supposed to invite\nher to tea.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 97\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the\nfacade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale\nlight, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby\nand Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied\nface floated along the dark cornices and blinding\nsigns, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tighten-\ning my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and\nso I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.\n\nCHAPTER\n######################\nOutput:"

By the next year\nI had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in\ntournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She\nwent with a slightly older crowd—when she went\nwith anyone at all.

In June she married Tom\nBuchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and cir-\ncumstance than Louisville ever knew before.

Tell ’em\nall Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’\nher mine!’”\nShe began to cry—sne cried and cried. I rushed\nout and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the\ndoor and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t\nlet go of the letter. She took it into the tub with\nher and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only\nlet me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that\nit was coming to pieces like snow.\nBut she didn’t say another word.

She used to\nsit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour,\nrubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at\nhim with unfathomable delight. It was touching to\nsee them together—it made you laugh in a hushed,\nfascinated way. That was in August. A week after\nI left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the\nVentura road one night, and ripped a front wheel\noff his car. The girl who was with him got into the\npapers, too, because her arm was broken—she was\none of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara\nHotel.\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they\nwent to France for a year.

This reminded\nme that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come\nback, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for\nher among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock\na greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumer-\nable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the\nfront door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a\nwhite flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie,\nhurried in. He was pale, and there were dark signs\nof sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\n“Ts everything all right?” he asked immediately.\n“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”\n“What grass?”’ he inquired blankly. ‘Oh, the\ngrass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it,\nbut, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he\nsaw a thing.\n\n102 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. ‘‘One\nof the papers said they thought the rain would stop\nabout four. 1 think it was The Journal. Have you\ngot everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”\nI took him into the pantry, where he looked a\nlittle reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scru-\ntinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen\nshop.\n“Will they do?” I asked.\n“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he\nadded hollowly, ‘‘. . . old sport.”\nThe rain cooled about half-past three to a damp\nmist, through which occasional thin drops swam like\ndew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a\ncopy of Clay’s “Economics,” starting at the Fin-\nnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering\ntoward the bleared windows from time to time as\nif a series of invisible but alarming happenings\nwere taking place outside. Finally he got up and\ninformed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was\ngoing home.\n“Why’s that?”\n“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He\nlooked at his watch as if there was some pressing\ndemand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t wait all\nday.”\n“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”\nHe sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him,\nand simultaneously there was the sound of a motor\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 103\nturning into my lane. We both jumped up, and, a\nlittle harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.\nUnder the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open\ncar was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s\nface, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lav-\nender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic\nsmile.\n“Ts this absolutely where you live, my dearest\none?”\nThe exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild\ntonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it\nfor a moment, up and down, with my ear alone,\nbefore any words came through. A damp streak of\nhair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek,\nand her hand was wet with glistening drops as I\ntook it to help her from the car.\n“‘Are you in love with me,” she said low in my\near, ‘“‘or why did I have to come alone?”\n“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your\nchauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.”\n‘Come back in an hour, Ferdie.”” Then in a grave\nmurmur: “His name is Ferdie.”\n““Does the gasoline affect his nose?”\n“T don’t think so,” she said innocently. ‘‘Why?”\nWe went in.

It\nwasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of\nmy own heart I pulled the door to against the in-\ncreasing rain.\nFor half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then\nfrom the living-room I heard a sort of choking mur-\nmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice\non a clear artificial note:\n“T certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”\nA pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to\ndo in the hall, so I went into the room.\nGatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclin-\ning against the mantelpiece in a strained counter-\nfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head\nleaned back so far that it rested against the face of\na defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position\nhis distraught eyes stared down at Daisy, who was\nsitting, frightened but graceful, on the edge of a\nstiff chair.\n““We’ve met before,”’ muttered Gatsby.

I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace\nout of the thousand in my head.\n“Tt’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had\nsmashed in pieces on the floor.\n“We haven’t met for many years,” , said Daisy,\nher voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\n“Five years next November.”\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us\nall back at least another minute. I had them both\non their feet with the desperate suggestion that they\nhelp me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac\nFinn brought it in on a tray.\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a\ncertain physical decency established itself. Gatsby\ngot himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I\ntalked, looked conscientiously from one to the other\nof us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calm-\nness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the\nfirst possible moment, and got to my feet.\n‘““Where are you going?”? demanded Gatsby in\nimmediate alarm.\n“Tl be back.”\n\n106 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T’ve got to speak to you about something be-\nfore you go.”\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed\nthe door, and whispered: ““Oh, God!” in a miser-\nable way.\n“What’s the matter?”\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his\nhead from side to side, “‘a terrible, terrible mistake.”\n““You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily\nI added: ‘‘Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\n“‘She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\n“Just as much as you are.”\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\n“You’re acting like a little boy,”’ I broke out im-\npatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude. Daisy’s\nsitting in there all alone.”\nHe raised his hand to stop my words, looked at\nme with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the\ndoor cautiously, went back into the other room.\nI walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had\nwhen he had made his nervous circuit of the house\nhalf an hour before—and ran for a huge black\nknotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric\nagainst the rain. Once more it was pouring, and\nmy irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gar-\ndener, abounded in small muddy swamps and pre-\nhistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at\nfrom under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house,\nso I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 107\nhalf an hour. A brewer had built it early in the\n“period” craze, a decade before, and there was a\nstory that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all\nthe neighboring cottages if the owners would have\ntheir roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their re-\nfusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a\nFamily—he went into an immediate decline. His\nchildren sold his house with the black wreath still\non the door. Americans, while willing, even eager,\nto be serfs, have always been obstinate about being\npeasantry.\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the\ngrocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with\nthe raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure\nhe wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began open-\ning the upper windows of his house, appeared mo-\nmentarily in each, and, leaning from the large cen-\ntral bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was\ntime I went back. While the rain continued it had\nseemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and\nswelling a little now and then with gusts of emo-\ntion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had\nfallen within the house too.\nI went in—after making every possible noise in\nthe kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I\ndon’t believe they heard a sound.

      "return": "##  Analysis and Entities from \"The Great Gatsby\" Excerpt:\r\n\r\n**Characters & Relationships (Central to the excerpt):**\r\n* **Jay Gatsby:**  Obsessed with Daisy, re-evaluates his entire lavish lifestyle through her eyes. Displays fluctuating emotions: embarrassment, unreasoning joy, culminating in wonder at her presence.\r\n* **Daisy Buchanan:**  Object of Gatsby's affection. Her actions and reactions deeply influence Gatsby's feelings and demeanor. Represents a desired past and idealized love for Gatsby.\r\n* **Narrator (Nick Carraway):** Observer and commentator, witnessing Gatsby's infatuation and the dynamics unfolding in his mansion.\r\n* **Mr. Klipspringer:**  A \"boarder\" at Gatsby's, depicted as almost ghostly and unnoticed amidst the grand setting, highlighting Gatsby's singular focus on Daisy.\r\n\r\n**Settings & Atmosphere:**\r\n* **Gatsby's Mansion:**  Symbol of wealth and Gatsby's attempt to recreate a past with Daisy. Described in detail, emphasizing its grandeur and emptiness (lack of actual guests save for brief moments). The atmosphere shifts from staged opulence to an almost surreal quiet punctuated by Gatsby's emotional outbursts.\r\n* **Symbolic Spaces:** \"Merton College Library,\" \"Marie Antoinette music-rooms,\"  etc., showcase Gatsby's curated past and desire to impress Daisy with a fabricated history and ambiance.\r\n\r\n**Themes Emerging (Strong in this excerpt):**\r\n* **Idealization and Illusion:** Gatsby's meticulously constructed world is centered around an idealized image of Daisy and their past. Reality and fantasy blur.\r\n* **The Power of Presence:** Daisy's physical presence utterly transforms Gatsby's perception and actions, revealing his deep dependence on her validation.\r\n* **Loneliness Amidst Excess:** Despite the lavish mansion and possessions, a sense of profound loneliness pervades Gatsby's existence, highlighting the emptiness without genuine connection.\r\n* **Performance and Authenticity:** Gatsby stages an elaborate performance to impress Daisy, questioning the genuineness behind the curated spectacle.\r\n\r\n**Narrative Techniques:**\r\n* **Close Third-Person Perspective:**  We experience Gatsby's thoughts and feelings intensely through Nick's narration, adding intimacy and psychological depth.\r\n* **Descriptive Language:** Vivid imagery of the mansion, scents, and Gatsby's shifting emotions create a rich sensory experience for the reader.\r\n* **Foreshadowing:** Gatsby's near fall down the stairs and his struggle to articulate his feelings hint at underlying fragility and the potential for disillusionment. \n\n\nThis excerpt masterfully sets the stage for exploring the complexities of love, illusion, and societal facades in \"The Great Gatsby.\"",

But there was a\nchange in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He\nliterally glowed; without a word or a gesture of ex-\nultation a new well-being radiated from him and\nfilled the little room.\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t\nseen me for years. I thought for a moment he was\ngoing to shake hands.\n“Tt’s stopped raining.”\n““Has it?’? When he realized what I was talking\nabout, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in\nthe room, he smiled like a weather man, like an\necstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the\nnews to Daisy. “‘What do you think of that? It’s\nstopped raining.”\n“T’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, griev-\ning beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\n“T want you and Daisy to come over to my\nhouse,”’ he said, ‘‘I’d like to show her around.”\n““You’re sure you want me to come?”\n“Absolutely, old sport.”\nDaisy went up-stairs to wash her face—too late\nI thought with humiliation of my towels—while\nGatsby and I waited on the lawn.\n“My house looks well, doesn’t it?”’ he demanded.\n“See how the whole front of it catches the light.”\nI agreed that it was splendid.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY IoQ\n“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door\nand square tower. “It took me just three years to\nearn the money that bought it.”\n“T thought you inherited your money.”\n“T did, old sport,” he said automatically, ‘but\nI lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the\nwar.”\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for\nwhen I asked him what business he was in he an-\nswered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that\nit wasn’t an appropriate reply.\n“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected\nhimself. ‘‘I was in the drug business and then I was\nin the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.”\nHe looked at me with more attention. ‘““Do you\nmean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed\nthe other night?”\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the\nhouse and two rows of brass buttons on her dress\ngleamed in the sunlight.\n“That huge place there?’ she cried pointing.\n“Do you like it?”\n“T love it, but I don’t see how you live there all\nalone.”\n“T keep it always full of interesting people, night\nand day. People who do interesting things. Cele-\nbrated people.”\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound\nwe went down to the road and entered by the big\n\n110 THE GREAT GATSBY\npostern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired\nthis aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against\nthe sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of\njonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum\nblossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-\ngate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and\nfind no stir of bright dresses in and out the door,\nand hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie An-\ntoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt\nthat there were guests concealed behind every\ncouch and table, under orders to be breathlessly\nsilent until we had passed through. As Gatsby\nclosed the door of “the Merton College Library” I\ncould have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break\ninto ghostly laughter.\nWe went up-stairs, through period bedrooms\nswathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with\nnew flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,\nand bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into\none chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas\nwas doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr.\nKlipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wan-\ndering hungrily about the beach that morning.\nFinally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bed-\nroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we\nsat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he\ntook from a cupboard in the wall.\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY III\nthink he revalued everything in his house according\nto the measure of response it drew from her well-\nloved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his\npossessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual\nand astounding presence none of it was any longer\nreal. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of\nstairs.\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except\nwhere the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of\npure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight,\nand smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down\nand shaded his eyes and began to laugh.\n‘It’s the funniest thing, old sport,”’ he said hilari-\nously. “I can’t— When I try to——”\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was\nentering upon a third. After his embarrassment and\nhis unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder\nat her presence. He had been full of the idea so\nlong, dreamed it right through to the end, waited\nwith his teeth set, so to\n######################\nOutput:"

Central Characters & Transformations:**\r\n   * **Jay Gatsby (formerly James Gatz):**  The core focus. His carefully crafted persona, symbolized by the name change, reveals a deliberate self-invention. He transcends his humble origins, becoming a \"son of God\" in his own mind, driven by ambition and a romanticized ideal.\r\n   * **Shift from James to Jay:** This renaming at age 17 marks a pivotal point where Gatsby embraces his idealized self, distancing himself from his past and parents. His encounter with Dan Cody solidifies this transformation.\r\n\r\n**2. Reputation & Mythmaking:**\r\n   * **Gatsby's Notoriety:**  Spreads organically through his lavish parties and enigmatic nature. Rumors (\"underground pipeline,\" living in a boat)  attach themselves, blurring reality and myth.\r\n   * **Impact of Stories:** These invented narratives highlight how Gatsby's public image, fueled by whispers and acceptance of his hospitality, becomes a self-perpetuating legend.\r\n\r\n**3. Influences and Inspirations:**\r\n   * **Dan Cody:** A pivotal figure who symbolizes wealth, adventure, and perhaps a model for Gatsby's aspirations. The encounter on Lake Superior triggers Gatsby's shift towards self-creation.\r\n   * **Platonic Conception:** Gatsby constructs his identity based on an idealized vision, not grounded solely in reality. This hints at a longing for something grander and beyond ordinary life.\r\n\r\n**4.  Themes Emerging:**\r\n   * **Self-invention and Illusion:** Gatsby's narrative is central to exploring how individuals shape identities and construct realities to fulfill desires.\r\n   * **The Allure of Myth:**  Society's fascination with creating and accepting narratives, even fantastical ones, adds another layer to Gatsby's story.\r\n   * **Ambition and Escapism:** Gatsby's pursuit transcends material wealth; it's a quest for a mythical self and a life divorced from his origins.\n\n\n**Relationships (Connecting Entities):**\r\n* **Gatsby (James Gatz) <-> Transformation:**  His name change signifies a complete metamorphosis driven by ambition and self-creation.\r\n* **Gatsby <-> Reputation/Myths:** His lavish lifestyle and enigmatic nature breed rumors and legends, shaping his public image.\r\n* **Cody <-> Gatsby's Inspiration:** Cody serves as a catalyst and model, influencing Gatsby's trajectory.\r\n* **Platonic Ideal <-> Gatsby's Identity:**  His constructed self stems from an idealized vision, not purely factual origins.\r\n* **Society <-> Mythmaking:**  People readily embrace and perpetuate Gatsby's myths, highlighting societal tendencies.",

There must have been moments\neven that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of\nhis dreams—not through her own fault, but because\nof the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone\nbeyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown\nhimself into it with a creative passion, adding to it\nall the time, decking it out with every bright feather\nthat drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness\ncan challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly\nheart.\nAs I watched him he adjusted himself a little,\nvisibly. His hand took hold of hers, and as she said\nsomething low in his ear he turned toward her with\na rush of emotion. I think that voice held him\nmost, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because\nit couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a death-\nless song.\nThey had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up\nand held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now\nat all. I looked once more at them and they looked\nback at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.\nThen I went out of the room and down the marble\nsteps into the rain, leaving them there together.\n\nCHAPTER VI\nABOUT this time an ambitious young reporter from\nNew York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and\nasked him if he had anything to say.\n“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby\npolitely.\n“‘Why—any statement to give out.”\nIt transpired after a confused five minutes that\nthe man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office\nin a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or\ndidn’t fully understand. This was his day off and\nwith laudable initiative he had hurried out “‘to see.”\nIt was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s in-\nstinct was right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about\nby the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality\nand so become authorities upon his past, had in-\ncreased all summer until he fell just short of being\nnews. Contemporary legends such as the “‘under-\nground pipe-line to Canada” attached themselves to\nhim, and there was one persistent story that he\ndidn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked\nlike a house and was moved secretly up and down\nthe Long Island shore. Just why these inventions\nwere a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North\nDakota, isn’t easy to say.\n117\n\n118 THE GREAT GATSBY\nJames Gatz—that was really, or at least legally,\nhis name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen\nand at the specific moment that witnessed the begin-\nning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht\ndrop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake\nSuperior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing\nalong the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey\nand a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay\nGatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the\nTuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might\ncatch him and break him up in half an hour.\nI suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time,\neven then. His parents were shiftless and unsuc-\ncessful farm people—his imagination had never really\naccepted them as his parents at all. The truth was\nthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang\nfrom his Platonic conception of himself. He was a\nson of God—a phrase which, if it means anything,\nmeans just that—and he must be about His Fa-\nther\n######################\nOutput:"

His parents were shiftless and unsuc-\ncessful farm people—his imagination had never really\naccepted them as his parents at all. The truth was\nthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang\nfrom his Platonic conception of himself. He was a\nson of God—a phrase which, if it means anything,\nmeans just that—and he must be about His Fa-\nther’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and\nmeretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort\nof Jay Gatsby that a seventeen year-old boy would\nbe likely to invent, and to this conception he was\nfaithful to the end.\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along\nthe south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger\nand a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that\nbrought him food and bed. His brown, hardening\nbody lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 119g\nlazy work of the bracing days. He knew women\nearly, and since they spoiled him he became contemp-\ntuous of them, of young virgins because they were\nignorant, of the others because they were hysterical\nabout things which in his overwhelming self-absorb-\ntion he took for granted.\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.\nThe most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted\nhim in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudi-\nness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked\non the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night\nhe added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsi-\nness closed down upon some vivid scene with an\noblivious embrace. For a while these reveries pro-\nvided an outlet for his imagination; they were a\nsatisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise\nthat the rock of the world was founded securely on\na fairy’s wing.\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him,\nsome months before, to the small Lutheran College\nof St. Olaf’s in northern Minnesota. He stayed there\ntwo weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to\nthe drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and de-\nspising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay\nhis way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to\ndo on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor\nin the shallows alongshore.\n\n120 THE GREAT GATSBY\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the\nNevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for\nmetal since seventy-five. The transactions in Mon-\ntana copper that made him many times a millionaire\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-\nmindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number\nof women tried to separate him from his money.\nThe none too savory ramifications by which Ella\nKaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de\nMaintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in\na yacht, were common property of the turgid jour-\nnalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too\nhospitable shores for five years when he turned up\nas James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.\nTo young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking\nup at the railed deck, that yacht represented all\nthe beauty and glamour in the world. 1 suppose he\nsmiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that\npeople liked him when he smiled. At any rate\nCody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited\nthe brand new name) and found that he was quick\nand extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he\ntook him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six\npair of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.\nAnd when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and\nthe Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity—\nwhile he remained with Cody he was in turn steward,\nmate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 121\nCody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody\ndrunk might soon be about, and he provided for such\ncontingencies by reposing more and more trust in\nGatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during\nwhich the boat went three times around the Con-\ntinent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for\nthe fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in\nBoston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably\ndied.\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s\nbedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face\n—the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of\nAmerican life brought back to the Eastern seaboard\nthe savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.\nIt was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so\nlittle. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women\nused to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he\nformed the habit of letting liquor alone.\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money—\na legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t\nget it. He never understood the legal device that\nwas used against him, but what remained of the\nmillions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with\nhis singularly appropriate education; the vague con-\ntour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality\n######################\nOutput:"

The \"massive woman\" defends her, suggesting a pattern.\r\n    * **Tom's Behavior:** Initially aloof (\"oblivion\"), then joins a lively table, indicating shifting moods within the party.\r\n    * **Daisy's Sentiment:** Not fully enjoying herself except during her brief time alone with Gatsby. Hints at a disconnect or underlying tension.\r\n* **Atmosphere/Mood Shifts:**\r\n    * **Initially:**  Sparkling, celebratory, many people, champagne (\"profusion...many-colored, many-keyed commotion\")\r\n    * **Shifting to:**  A \"pervading harshness,\"  \"septic\" feeling for Nick (narrator),  suggesting  underlying unease despite the facade. \r\n    * **Alcohol's Influence:**  Amplifies emotions and behaviors, contributing to the shifting mood.\n\n**Key Takeaways (Thematic):**\r\n* **Superficiality vs. Reality:** The lavish party masks complex emotions and tensions beneath the surface. Alcohol exposes this further.\r\n* **Social Dynamics & Perception:** How people present themselves versus their true feelings (Daisy's discomfort, Tom's shifting roles).\r\n* **The Impact of Excess:**  Alcohol's role in influencing behavior and highlighting cracks in the glamorous veneer.",

His background and true identity are unclear, fueling intrigue.\r\n* **Daisy:** Caught between Gatsby's romantic allure and her established life with Tom. Shows interest in Gatsby but remains tied to her world and uncertainties about the future.\r\n* **Tom:**  Daisy's husband, openly skeptical of Gatsby and his wealth, viewing him as a \"bootlegger.\" Represents societal norms and established power Daisy partly inhabits.\r\n* **Nick Carraway (Narrator):** Observer and participant, privy to conversations and atmosphere. His perspective highlights the complexities and unspoken desires within the group.\r\n\r\n* **Other Party Guests (Implicit):**  Mentioned as uninvited attendees, emphasizing Gatsby's openness and the blurred lines of society at his gatherings.\r\n    * **\"Girl\" who asked Daisy for a cold shower:**  Symbol of casual intrusion and the unconventional nature of Gatsby's parties.\r\n\r\n**Themes & Motifs Emergent in this Passage:**\r\n\r\n* **Illusion vs. Reality:** Gatsby's carefully constructed persona and lavish parties mask underlying questions about his true origins and motives. Daisy grapples with romanticizing an image versus understanding the reality.\r\n* **Desire and Longing:** Daisy's attraction to Gatsby stems from a longing for something different, a spark absent in her current life. This fuels tension and internal conflict.\r\n* **Social Class and New Wealth:** Tom's prejudice against Gatsby highlights the societal judgment on newly acquired wealth, contrasting with Gatsby's attempts to integrate into elite circles.\r\n* **Romance and Uncertainty:** The \"romantic possibilities\" Nick observes hint at Gatsby's parties being a stage for fleeting connections and unspoken desires, culminating in the anticipation of an \"unbelievable guest\" who might disrupt the existing dynamics.\r\n* **Music and Atmosphere:**  \"Three o'Clock in the Morning\" symbolizes a liminal space, echoing the ambiguity and potential transformations happening within the narrative. The music itself influences Daisy's feelings and foreshadows unfolding events.\r\n\r\n**Key Events Leading into Climax:**\r\n\r\n* Tom's direct inquiry about Gatsby's background reveals his intent to expose and undermine him.\r\n* Daisy's contradictory statements (interest in Gatsby yet rooted in her world) showcase her internal struggle.\r\n* The lingering presence and Gatsby's request for Nick to wait suggest an impending reveal or crucial conversation.\r\n* The emphasis on the \"incalculable hours\" and potential arrival of a transformative guest builds suspense towards a pivotal moment in the narrative. \n\n\nThis passage masterfully sets the stage for further conflict, romantic tension, and societal revelations within the world of *The Great Gatsby*.",

At this inquiry she sat\nup and opened her eyes.\n6cW ha’ ? 99\nA massive and lethargic woman, who had been\nurging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club\nto-morrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or\nsix cocktails she always starts screaming like that.\nT tell her she ought to leave it alone.”\n“T do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hol-\nlowly.\n“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY I29\nhere: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help,\nDoc.’”\n“‘She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another\nfriend, without gratitude, “but you ’got her dress\nall wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”\n“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a\npool,”” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost\ndrowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered\nDoctor Civet.\n“Speak for yourself!” ihe a cried Miss Baedeker vio-\nlently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you\noperate on me!”\nIt was like that. Almost the last thing I remember\nwas standing with Daisy and watching the moving-\npicture director and his Star. They were still under\nthe white-plum tree and their faces were touching\nexcept for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.\nIt occurred to me that he had been very slowly bend-\ning toward her all evening to attain this proximity,\nand even while I watched I saw him stoop one ulti-\nmate degree and kiss at her cheek.\n“‘T like her,” said Daisy, ‘“‘I think she’s lovely.”\nBut the rest offended her—and inarguably, be-\ncause it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was\nappalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “‘place”’\nthat Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island\nfishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed\nunder the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive\n\n130 THE GREAT GATSBY\nfate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut\nfrom nothing to nothing. She saw something awful\nin the very simplicity she failed to understand.\nI sat on the front steps with them while they\nwaited for their car. It was dark here in front; only\nthe bright door sent ten square feet of light volley-\ning out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a\nshadow moved against a dressing-room blind above,\ngave way to another shadow, an indefinite proces-\nsion of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\ninvisible glass.\n“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom\nsuddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”\n““Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n“‘T didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these\nnewly rich people are just big bootleggers, you\nknow.”\n“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\nHe was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the\ndrive crunched under his feet.\n“‘Well, he certainly must have strained himself to\nget this menagerie together.”\nA breeze stirred the gray haze of Daisy’s fur col-\nlar.\n“At least they are more interesting than the\npeople we know,” she said with an effort.\n“You didn’t look so interested.”\n“Well, I was.”\nTom laughed and turned to me.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 131\n“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked\nher to put her under a cold shower?”\nDaisy began to sing with the music in a husky,\nrythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each\nword that it had never had before and would never\nhave again. When the melody rose her voice broke\nup sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices\nhave, and each change tipped out a little of her warm\nhuman magic upon the air.\n“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,”\nshe said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited.\nThey simply force their way in and he’s too polite\nto object.”\n“‘T’d like to know who he is and what he does,”\ninsisted Tom. “And I think I'll make a point of find-\ning out.”\n“T can tell you right now,” she answered. “He\nowned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores. He\nbuilt them up himself.”\nThe dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\nHer glance left me and sought the lighted top of\nthe steps, where ‘‘Three o’Clock in the Morning,”\na neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out\nthe open door. After all, in the very casualness of\nGatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities\ntotally absent from her world.

Perhaps some unbelievable guest would\narrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled\nat, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical\nencounter, would blot out those five years of un-\nwavering devotion.\nI stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait\nuntil he was free, and I lingered in the garden until\nthe inevitable swimming party\n######################\nOutput:"

Perhaps some unbelievable guest would\narrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled\nat, some authentically radiant young girl who with\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical\nencounter, would blot out those five years of un-\nwavering devotion.\nI stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait\nuntil he was free, and I lingered in the garden until\nthe inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled\nand exalted, from the black beach, until the lights\nwere extinguished in the guest-rooms overhead.\nWhen he came down the steps at last the tanned skin\nwas drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\nwere bright and tired.\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n“Of course she did.”\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “‘She didn’t have\na good time.”\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable\ndepression.\n“T feel far away from her,” he said. ‘It’s hard to\nmake her understand.”\n“You mean about the dance?”\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had\ngiven with a snap of his fingers. ‘‘Old sport, the dance\nis unimportant.”\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she\nshould go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.”\nAfter she had obliterated four years with that sen-\ntence they could decide upon the more practical\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 133\nmeasures to be taken. One of them was that, after\nshe was free, they were to go back to Louisville and\nbe married from her house—just as if it were five\nyears ago.\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. ‘‘She used\nto be able to understand. We'd sit for hours——”’\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a\ndesolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and\ncrushed flowers.\n“T wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured.\n“You can’t repeat the past.”\n“‘Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously.\n“Why of course you can!”\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were\nlurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of\nreach of his hand.\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was\nbefore,” he said, nodding determinedly. ‘‘She’ll see.”\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that\nhe wanted to recover something, some idea of him-\nself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His\nlife had been confused and disordered since then,\nbut if he could once return to a certain starting\nplace and go over it all slowly, he could find out\nwhat that thing was... .\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they\nhad been walking down the street when the leaves\nwere falling, and they came to a place where there\nwere no trees and the sidewalk was white with moon-\nlight. They stopped here and turned toward each\n\n134 THE GREAT GATSBY\nother. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious\nexcitement in it which comes at the two changes of\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were hum-\nming out into the darkness and there was a stir and\nbustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye\nGatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above\nthe trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone,\nand once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp\ndown the incomparable milk of wonder.\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white\nface came up to his own. He knew that when he\nkissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable vi-\nsions to her perishable breath, his mind would never\nromp again like the mind of God. So he waited,\nlistening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork\nthat had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\nher. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like\na flower and the incarnation was complete.\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling\nsentimentality, I was reminded of something—an\nelusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had\nheard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a\nphrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips\nparted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more\nstruggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.\nBut they made no sound, and what I had almost\nremembered was uncommunicable forever.\n\nCHAPTER VII\nIr was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its\nhighest that the lights in his house failed to go on one\nSaturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun,\nhis career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually\ndid I become aware that the automobiles which\nturned expectantly into his drive stayed for just\na minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering\nif he were sick I went over to find out—an unfa-\nmiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me\nsuspiciously from the door.\n“Ts Mr. Gatsby sick?”\n‘“‘Nope.” After a pause he added “‘sir’’ in a dila-\ntory, grudging way.\n*“‘T hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather wor-\nried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\n“Carraway.”\n“Carraway. All right, PU tell him.”\n######################\nOutput:"

Instinct made him\nstep on the accelerator with the double purpose of\novertaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and\nwe sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,\nuntil, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we\ncame in sight of the easy-going blue coupé.\n“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are\ncool,” suggested Jordan. “I love New York on sum-\nmer afternoons when every one’s away. There’s\nsomething very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all\nsorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your\nhands.”\nThe word “‘sensuous” had the effect of further dis-\nquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest\nthe coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to\ndraw up alongside.\n‘Where are we going?” she cried.\n“How about the movies?”\n“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We'll\nride around and meet you after.” With an effort her\nwit rose faintly, ‘‘We’ll meet you on some corner.\nI'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”\n“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impa-\ntiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind\nus. “You follow me to the south side of Central\nPark, in front of the Plaza.”\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back\nfor their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed\nup until they came into sight.

And we all took the less explica-\nble step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza\nHotel.\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that\nended by herding us into that room eludes me,\nthough I have a sharp physical memory that, in the\ncourse of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp\nsnake around my legs and intermittent beads of\nsweat raced cool across my back. The notion origi-\nnated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bath-\nrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more\ntangible form as ‘‘a place to have a mint julep.”\nEach of us said over and over that it was a “‘crazy\nidea””—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and\nthought, or pretended to think, that we were being\nvery funny...\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it\nwas already four o’clock, opening the windows ad-\nmitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.\nDaisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to\nus, fixing her hair.\n“Tt’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respect-\nfully, and every one laughed.\n“Open another window,” commanded Daisy,\nwithout turning around.\n“There aren’t any more.”\n“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe——”\n\n152 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said\nTom impatiently. “You make it ten times worse by\ncrabbing about it.”\nHe unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel\nand put it on the table.\n“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked\nGatsby. “‘You’re the one that wanted to come to\ntown.”\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone\nbook slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor,\nwhereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but\nthis time no one laughed.\n“Tl pick it up,” I offered.\n“‘’ve got it.”” Gatsby examined the parted string,\nmuttered ‘‘Hum!”’ in an interested way, and tossed\nthe book on a chair.\n““That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said\nTom sharply.\n“What is?”\n“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick\nthat up?”\n““Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around\nfrom the mirror, “‘if you’re going to make personal\nremarks I won’t stay here a minute. Call up and\norder some ice for the mint julep.”\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed\nheat exploded into sound and we were listening\nto the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding\nMarch from the ballroom below.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 153\n“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat !”” cried\nJordan dismally.\n“Still—I was married in the middle of June,”\nDaisy remembered, “Louisville in June! Somebody\nfainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”\n“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.\n“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he\nmade boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi,\nTennessee.”\n“They carried him into my house,” appended\nJordan, “‘because we lived just two doors from the\nchurch. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left\nDaddy died.” After a moment she added. ‘‘\n######################\nOutput:"

As we passed over the dark\nbridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s\nshoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died\naway with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling\ntwilight.\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee\njoint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness\nat the inquest. He had slept through the heat until\n\n164 THE GREAT GATSBY\nafter five, when he strolled over to the garage, and\nfound George Wilson sick in his office—really sick,\npale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Mich-\naelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused,\nsaying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While\nhis neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent\nracket broke out overhead.\n“T’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained\nWilson calmly. ‘“‘She’s going to stay there till the\nday after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move\naway.”\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neigh-\nbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed\nfaintly capable of such a statement. Generally he\nwas one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t\nworking, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared\nat the people and the cars that passed along the\nroad. When any one spoke to him he invariably\nlaughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his\nwife’s man and not his own.\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had\nhappened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead\nhe began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his\nvisitor and ask him what he’d been doing at cer-\ntain times on certain days. Just as the latter was\ngetting uneasy, some workmen came past the door\nbound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the op-\nportunity to get away, intending to come back later.\nBut he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all.\nWhen he came outside again, a little after seven, he\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 165\nwas reminded of the conversation because he heard\nMrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, down-stairs\nin the garage.\n“Beat me!” he heard her cry. ‘Throw me down\nand beat me, you dirty little coward!”\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk,\nwaving her hands and shouting—before he could\nmove from his door the business was over.\nThe “death car” as the newspapers called it,\ndidn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness,\nwavered tragically for a moment, and then disap-\npeared around the next bend. Mavromichaelis\nwasn’t even sure of its color—he told the first police-\nman that it was light green. The other car, the one\ngoing toward New York, came to rest a hundred\nyards beyond, and it’s driver hurried back to where\nMyrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt\nin the road and mingled her thick dark blood with\nthe dust.\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but\nwhen they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp\nwith perspiration, they saw that her left breast was\nswinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to\nlisten for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide\nopen and ripped a little at the corners, as though\nshe had choked al ittle in giving up the tremendous\nvitality she had stored so long.\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the\ncrowd when we were still some distance away\n\n166 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll\nhave a little business at last.”\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention\nof stopping, until, as we came nearer, the hushed,\nintent faces of the people at the garage door made\nhim automatically put on the brakes.\n“We'll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a\nlook.”\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound\nwhich issued incessantly from the garage, a sound\nwhich as we got out of the coupé and walked toward\nthe door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my\nGod!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n“There’s some bad trouble here,”’ said Tom ex-\ncitedly.\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle\nof heads into the garage, which was lit only by a\nyellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead.\nThen he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with\na violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms\npushed his way through.\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur\nof expostulation; it was a minute before I could see\nanything at all. Then new arrivals deranged the\nline, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly in-\nside.\nMyrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and\nthen in another blanket, as though she suffered from\na chill in the hot night, lay on a work-table by the\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 167\nwall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\nover it, motionless.

Next to him stood a motor-\ncycle policeman taking down names with much\nsweat and correction in a little book. At first I\ncouldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words\nthat echoed clamorously through the bare garage—\nthen I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold\nof his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was\ntalking to him in a low voice and attempting, from\ntime to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but\nWilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop\nslowly from the swinging light to the laden table by\nthe wall, and then jerk back to the light again, and\nhe gave out incessantly his high, horrible call:\n“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh,\nmy Ga-od !”\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and,\nafter staring around the garage with glazed eyes,\naddressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the\npoliceman.\n““M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, ‘“—o——”’\n“No, r—” corrected the man, “‘ M-a-v-r-o——”\n“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.\n““r—” said the policeman, ‘‘o——”\nce g ”?\n““g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell\nsharply on his shoulder. ‘‘What you want, fella?”’\n“What happened P—that’s what I want to know.”\n\n168 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”\n“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.\n‘She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even\nstopus car.”\n“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one\ncomin’, one goin’, see?”\n“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.\n“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand\nrose toward the blankets but stopped half way and\nfell to his side—‘‘she ran out there an’ the one\ncomin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’\nthirty or forty miles an hour.”\n““What’s the name of this place here?” demanded\nthe officer.\n“Hasn’t got any name.”\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\n“Tt was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car.\nNew.”\n“See the accident?” asked the policeman.\n“No, but the car passed me down the road, going\nfaster’n forty. Going fifty, sixty.”\n“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out\nnow. I want to get his name.”\nSome words of this conversation must have reached\nWilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a\nnew theme found voice among his gasping cries:\n“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it\nwas! I know what kind of car it was!”\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 169\nhis shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked\nquickly over to Wilson and, standing in front of\nhim seized him, firmly by the upper arms.\n“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said\nwith soothing gruffness.\nWilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his\ntiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees\nhad not Tom held him upright.\n“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him al ittle. “TI just\ngot here a minute ago, from New York. I was\nbringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about.\nThat yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t\nmine—do you hear? I haven’t seen it all after-\nnoon.”\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear\nwhat he said, but the policeman caught something\nin the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n“Tm a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but\nkept his hands firm on Wilson’s body. ‘‘He says\nhe knows the car that did it.... It was a yellow\ncar.”\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look\nsuspiciously at Tom.\n“And what color’s your car?”\n“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”\n““We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.\nSome one who had been driving a little behind us\nconfirmed this, and the policeman turned away.\n\n170 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“‘Now, if you’ll let me have that name again cor-\nrect——”’\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him\ninto the office, set him down in a chair, and came\nback.\n“Tf somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he\nsnapped authoritatively. He watched while the two\nmen standing closest glanced at each other and went\nunwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door\non them and came down the single step, his eyes\navoiding the table. As he passed close to me he\nwhispered: ‘‘Let’s get out.”\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms break-\ning the way, we pushed through the still gathering\ncrowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who\nhad been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\nTom drove slowly until\n######################\nOutput:"

Ambitious but ultimately driven by love and longing for the past.\r\n* **Daisy:**  Attractive, wealthy, embodies the allure and privilege Gatsby desires. Initially portrayed as carefree and somewhat unaware of Gatsby's true situation, but develops genuine feelings for him.\r\n* **Narrator (Nick Carraway):** Observer and storyteller, provides insights into Gatsby's character and his relationship with Daisy.\r\n\r\n**Relationships & Key Events (Deduced from the Passage):**\r\n\r\n1. **Love & Obsession (Gatsby - Daisy):**  The central theme. Gatsby is infatuated with Daisy,  viewing her as extraordinary and \"extraordinary a 'nice' girl\" could be. He strives to create an image worthy of her love, even resorting to deception initially.\r\n2. **Illusion vs. Reality:** Gatsby constructs a facade of wealth and success to impress Daisy, hiding his penniless beginnings and uncertain future. This creates a tension between his manufactured persona and genuine feelings.\r\n3. **Shared Moments & Connection:**  Despite the disparity in their backgrounds, intimate moments like sitting by the fire, gentle touches, and whispered conversations forge a profound connection between them. Gatsby finds solace and fulfillment in these shared experiences.\r\n4. **Parting & Uncertainty:** Daisy's letters reveal worry and Gatsby's impending departure abroad adds a layer of anxiety and uncertainty to their burgeoning love. The passage ends hinting at a potential rift due to circumstances beyond their control.\r\n5. **Gatsby's Military Success & Displacement:** While Gatsby excels in the war, bureaucratic complications send him to Oxford instead of home to Daisy, further straining their connection.\r\n\r\n**Implicit Themes Emerging:**\r\n* **The American Dream & its Discontents:** Gatsby's pursuit of wealth symbolizes chasing an idealized version of success, but true happiness seems tied to genuine connection, not material possessions.\r\n* **Love & Class Divide:**  Their romance explores how societal barriers and differing backgrounds influence love and its complexities.\r\n* **Nostalgia & the Past's Grip:** Gatsby's yearning for Daisy is rooted in a romanticized past, highlighting the human tendency to seek solace in idealized memories. \r\n\r\n**Note:** Further analysis of the complete novel would enrich these understandings and reveal deeper thematic layers.",

I think that he would have acknowl-\nedged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted\nto talk about Daisy.\nShe was the first “nice” girl he had ever known.\nIn various unrevealed capacities he had come in\ncontact with such people, but always with indis-\ncernible barbed wire between. He found her excit-\ningly desirable. He went to her house, at first with\nother officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It\namazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful\nhouse before. But what gave it an air of breathless\nintensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as\ncasual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to\n\n178 THE GREAT GATSBY\nhim. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of\nbedrooms up-stairs more beautiful and cool than\nother bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking\nplace through its corridors, and of romances that\nwere not musty and laid away already in lavender\nbut fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s\nshining motor-cars and of dances whose flowers were\nscarcely withered. It excited him, too, that many\nmen had already loved Daisy—it increased her value\nin his eyes. He felt their presence all about the\nhouse, pervading the air with the shades and echoes\nof still vibrant emotions.\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a\ncolossal accident. However glorious might be his\nfuture as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless\nyoung man without a past, and at any moment\nthe invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from\nhis shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He\ntook what he could get, ravenously and unscru-\npulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October\nnight, took her because he had no real right to\ntouch her hand.\nHe might have despised himself, for he had\ncertainly taken her under false pretenses. I don’t\nmean that he had traded on his phantom millions,\nbut he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of se-\ncurity; he let her believe that he was a person from\nmuch the same strata as herseli—that he was fully\nable to take care of her. As a matter of fact, he had\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 179\nno such facilities—he had no comfortable family\nstanding behind him, and he was liable at the whim\nof an impersonal government to be blown anywhere\nabout the world.\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out\nas he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to\ntake what he could and go—but now he found that\nhe had committed himself to the following of a\ngrail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but\nhe didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice”\ngirl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into\nher rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt\nmarried to her, that was all.\nWhen they met again, two days later, it was\nGatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, be-\ntrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked\nfashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed\nher curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a\ncold, and it made her voice huskier and more charm-\ning than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly\naware of the youth and mystery that wealth im-\nprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many\nclothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and\nproud above the hot struggles of the poor.\n“T can’t describe to you how surprised I was to\nfind out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for\na while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, be-\n\n180 THE GREAT GATSBY\ncause she was in love with me too. She thought I\nknew a lot because I knew different things from her\n. . . Well, there I was, ’way off my ambitions, getting\ndeeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I\ndidn’t care. What was the use of doing great things\nif I could have a better time telling her what I was\ngoing to do?”\nOn the last afternoon before he went abroad, he\nsat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It\nwas a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her\ncheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he\nchanged his arm al ittle, and once he kissed her dark\nshining hair. The afternoon had made them tran-\nquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for\nthe long parting the next day promised. They had\nnever been closer in their month of love, nor com-\nmunicated more profoundly one with another, than\nwhen she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoul-\nder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently,\nas though she were asleep.\nHe did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a\ncaptain before he went to the front, and following the\nArgonne battles he got his majority and the com-\nmand of the divisional machine-guns.

And the result\nwas she hardly knew what she was saying.”\nHe sat down gloomily.\n“Of course she might have loved him just for a\nminute, when they were first married—and loved me\nmore even then, do you see?”\nSuddenly he came out with a curious remark.\n“Tn any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”\nWhat could you make of that, except to suspect\nsome intensity in his conception of the affair that\ncouldn’t be measured?\nHe came back from France when Tom and Daisy\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 183\nwere still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable\nbut irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of\nhis army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the\nstreets where their footsteps had clicked together\nthrough the November night and revisiting the out-\nof-the-way places to which they had driven in her\nwhite car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed\nto him more mysterious and gay than other houses,\nso his idea of the city itself, even though she was\ngone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.\nHe left feeling that if he had searched harder, he\nmight have found her—that he was leaving her be-\nhind. The day-coach—he was penniless now—was\nhot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down\non a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the\nbacks of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out\ninto the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced\nthem for a minute with people in it who might once\nhave seen the pale magic of her face along the casual\nstreet.\nThe track curved and now it was going away from\nthe sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread\nitself in benediction over the vanishing city where\nshe had drawn her breath. He stretched out his\nhand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air,\nto save a fragment of the spot that she had made\nlovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now\nfor his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost\nthat part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.\n\n184 THE GREAT GATSBY\nIt was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast\nand went out on the porch. The night had made a\nsharp difference in the weather and there was an\nautumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one\nof Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the\nsteps.\n“T’m going to drain the pool to-day, Mr. Gatsby.\nLeaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s\nalways trouble with the pipes.”\n“Don’t do it to-day,’ Gatsby answered. He\nturned to me apologetically.\n######################\nOutput:"

After that, he stayed there\nalone with Wilson until dawn.\nAbout three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s inco-\nherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and\nbegan to talk about the yellow car. He announced\nthat he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car\nbelonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of\nmonths ago his wife had come from the city with her\nface bruised and her nose swollen.\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched\nand began to cry “‘Oh, my God!” again in his groan-\ning voice.

The night had made a\nsharp difference in the weather and there was an\nautumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one\nof Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the\nsteps.\n“T’m going to drain the pool to-day, Mr. Gatsby.\nLeaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s\nalways trouble with the pipes.”\n“Don’t do it to-day,’ Gatsby answered. He\nturned to me apologetically. “You know, old sport,\nI’ve never used that pool all summer?”\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\n“Twelve minutes to my train,”\nI didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a\ndecent stroke of work, but it was more than that—\nI didn’t want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train,\nand then another, before I could get myself away.\n“T’ll call you up,” I said finally.\n“Do, old sport.”\n“T’ll call you about noon.”\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\n“T suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me\nanxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.\n“‘T suppose so.”\n“Well, good-by.”\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before\nI reached the hedge I remembered something and\nturned around.\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 185\n“‘They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the\nlawn. “You're worth the whole damn bunch put\ntogether.”\nI’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only\ncompliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved\nof him from beginning to end. First he nodded\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant\nand understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic\ncahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink\nrag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\nwhite steps, and I thought of the night when I first\ncame to his ancestral home, three months before.\nThe lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces\nof those who guessed at his corruption—and he had\nstood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible\ndream, as he waved them good-by.\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were al-\nways thanking him for that—I and the others.\n““Good-by,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast,\nGatsby.”\nUp in the city, I tried for a while to list the quo-\ntations on an interminable amount of stock, then\nI fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon\nthe phone woke me, and I started up with sweat\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker;\nshe often called me up at this hour because the un-\ncertainty of her own movements between hotels\nand clubs and private houses made her hard to find.\n\n186 THE GREAT GATSBY\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the\nwire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from\na green golf-links had come sailing in at the office\nwindow, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\n“T’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at\nHempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton\nthis afternoon.”\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house,\nbut the act annoyed me, and her next remark made\nme rigid.\n“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”\n“How could it have mattered then?”\nSilence for a moment. Then:\n““However—I want to see you.”\n“T want to see you, too.”\n“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come\ninto town this afternoon?”\n“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”\n“Very well.”\n“Tt’s impossible this afternoon. Various——’ >\nWe talked like that for a while, and then abruptly\nwe weren’t talking any longer. I don’t know which\nof us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn’t\ncare. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-\ntable that day if I never talked to her again in this\nworld.\nTI called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but\nthe line was busy. I tried four times; finally an ex-\nasperated central told me the wire was being kept\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 187\nopen for long distance from Detroit. Taking out\nmy time-table, I drew a small circle around the\nthree-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair\nand tried to think. It was just noon.\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that\nmorning I had crossed deliberately to the other side\nof the car. I supposed there’d be a curious crowd\naround there all day with little boys searching for\ndark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man tell-\ning over and over what had happened, until it be-\ncame less and less real even to him and he could\ntell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achieve-\nment was forgotten. Now I want to go back a\nlittle and tell what happened at the garage after\nwe left there the night before.\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.\nShe must have broken her rule against drinking that\nnight, for when she arrived she was stupid with\nliquor and unable to understand that the ambulance\nhad already gone to Flushing. When they convinced\nher of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was\nthe intolerable part of the affair. Some one, kind or\ncurious, took her in his car and drove her in the\nwake of her sister’s body.\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped\nup against the front of the garage,\n######################\nOutput:"

A new world, ma-\nterial without being real, where poor ghosts, breath-\ning dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about .. .\nlike that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him\nthrough the amorphous trees.\nThe chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s proté-\ngés—heard the shots—afterward he could only say\nthat he hadn’t thought anything much about them.\nI drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house\nand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was\nthe first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew\nthen, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said,\nfour of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I,\nhurried down to the pool.\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement\nof the water as the fresh flow from one end urged\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 195\nits way toward the drain at the other. With little\nripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the\nladen mattress moved irregularly down the pool.\nA small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the\nsurface was enough to disturb its accidental course\nwith its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster\nof leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of\ntransit, a thin red circle in the water.\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the\nhouse that the gardener saw Wilson’s body al ittle\nway off in the grass, and the holocaust was com-\nplete.\n\nCHAPTER IX\nAFTER two years I remember the rest of that day,\nand that night and the next day, only as an endless\ndrill of police and photographers and newspaper\nmen in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope\nstretched across the main gate and a policeman by\nit kept out the curious, but little boys soon discov-\nered that they could enter through my yard, and\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-\nmouthed about the pool. Some one with a positive\nmanner, perhaps a detective, used the expression\n“madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that\nafternoon, and the adventitious authority of his\nvoice set the key for the newspaper reports next\nmorning.\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—gro-\ntesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When\nMichaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light\nWilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole\ntale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade\n—but Catherine, who might have said anything,\ndidn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\nof character about it too—looked at the coroner with\ndetermined eyes under that corrected brow of hers,\nand swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby,\nthat her sister was completely happy with her hus-\n196\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 197\nband, that her sister had been into no mischief\nwhatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into\nher handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\nman ‘deranged by grief” in order that the case\nmight remain in its simplest form. And it rested\nthere.\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessen-\ntial. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone.\nFrom the moment I telephoned news of the catas-\ntrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about\nhim, and every practical question, was referred to\nme. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as\nhe lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was\nresponsible, because no one else was interested—\ninterested, I mean, with that intense personal in-\nterest to which every one has some vague right at\nthe end.\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him,\ncalled her instinctively and without hesitation. But\nshe and Tom had gone away early that afternoon,\nand taken baggage with them.\n“Left no address?”\n“cNs o.”\n““Say when they’d be back?”\n“No.”\n“Any idea where they are? How I could reach\nthem?”\n\n198 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“T don’t know. Can’t say.”\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to\ngo into the room where he lay and reassure him:\n“T’'ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry.\nJust trust me and I’ll get somebody for you ye\nMeyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone\nbook. The butler gave me his office address on\nBroadway, and I called Information, but by the\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and\nno one answered the phone.\n“Will you ring again?”\n“T’ve rung them three times.”\n“It’s very important.”\n“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for\nan instant that they were chance visitors, all these\nofficial people who suddenly filled it. But, though\nthey drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get some-\nbody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go\nthrough this alone.”\nSome one started to ask me questions, but I broke\naway and going up-stairs looked hastily through\nthe unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me\ndefinitely that his parents were dead.

When the butler brought back\nWolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of de-\nfiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and\nme against them all.\nDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most\nterrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that\nit is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should\nmake us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up\nin some very important business and cannot get mixed up in\nthis thing now. If there is anything I can doa l ittle later\nlet me know ina letter by Edgar.

But the connection came\nthrough as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.\n“This is Slagle speaking . . .”\n“Ves?” The name was unfamiliar.\n“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”\n“There haven’t been any wires.”\n“Young Parke’s in trouble,’ he said rapidly.\n‘They picked him up when he handed the bonds over\nthe counter. They got a circular from New York\ngiving ’°em the numbers just five minutes before.\nWhat d’you know about that, hey?

Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the\nwire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick\nsquawk as the connection was broken.\nI think it was on the third day that a telegram\nsigned Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minne-\nsota. It said only that the sender was leaving im-\nmediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\nIt was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very\nhelpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap\nulster against the warm September day. His eyes\nleaked continuously with excitement, and when I\ntook the bag and umbrella from his hands he began\nto pull so incessantly at his sparse gray beard that\nI had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 201\nthe point of collapse, so I took him into the music\nroom and made him sit down while I sent for some-\nthing to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and the glass of\nmilk spilled from his trembling hand.\n“T saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said.\n“Tt was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started\nright away.”\n“T didn’t know how to reach you.”\nHis eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about\nthe room.\n“Tt was a madman,” he said. “He must have\nbeen mad.”\n“‘Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.\n“JT don’t want anything. I’m all right now,\nMr—”’\n“Carraway.”\n“Well, I’m all night now. Where have they got\nJimmy ?” |\nI took him into the drawing-room, where his son\nlay, and left him there. Some little boys had come\nup on the steps and were looking into the hall; when\nI told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly\naway.\nAfter a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and\ncame out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly,\nhis eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears.

His meticulous schedule and rise to success align with Gatsby's portrayal.\r\n* **Mr. Gatz (George Wilson's Father):** Explicitly identified as Gatsby's father, deeply proud and reliant on memories/possessions linked to his son.\r\n* **\"Hop-along Cassidy\" Book:**  A tangible symbol of Gatsby's youthful aspirations and structured life even before his wealth. Establishes a contrast between then and his later persona.\r\n* **SCHEDULE (Septeraber 12, 1906):**  Key artifact revealing Gatsby's disciplined routine as a young man. Highlights themes of ambition, self-improvement, and planning.\r\n\r\n**Analysis & Connections within the Excerpt:**\r\n\r\n1. **Discipline & Ambition:** The detailed schedule showcases Gatsby's early focus on self-development (electricity study, elocution, \"needed inventions\"). This foreshadows his later relentless pursuit of success and the idealized life he crafts.\r\n2. **Contrasting Worlds:** The juxtaposition of the humble book and the elaborate schedule emphasizes the transformation Gatsby undergoes. His youthful aspirations find expression in a structured plan, hinting at the meticulously curated persona he builds later.\r\n3. **Fatherly Pride & Memory:** Mr. Gatz's treasure in this faded book demonstrates how tangible reminders of Gatsby's past hold immense value for him. It reinforces the emotional connection and idealized image the father holds of his son.\r\n4. **\"No Wasting Time...\":**  The resolves reveal Gatsby's aversion to idleness even then, setting a tone for his future driven nature. This foreshadows his relentless pursuit of wealth and Daisy, viewing time as precious capital to invest.\r\n5. **Symbolic Importance:** The book itself becomes a symbol bridging Gatsby's past and present. It represents the foundation upon which his ambitious self was built, adding layers to his complex character. \r\n\r\n**In Conclusion:** This seemingly simple book excerpt, when analyzed within the *Great Gatsby* context, offers profound insights into Gatsby's character arc, his disciplined nature, and the enduring impact of his past on his constructed future.",

He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days.\n“Come on have some lunch with me,’ I sid. He ate\nmore than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\n\n206 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\n“Start him! I made him.”\ncc Oh.”’\n“T raised him up out of nothing, right out of the\ngutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing,\ngentlemanly young man, and when he told me he\nwas an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I\ngot him to join up in the American Legion and he\nused to stand high there. Right off he did some\nwork for a client of mine up to Albany. We were\nso thick like that in everything”—he held up two\nbulbous fingers—‘‘always together.”\nT wondered if this partnership had included the\nWorld’s Series transaction in 1919.\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. ‘‘ You\nwere his closest friend, so I know you'll want to\ncome to his funeral this afternoon.”\n“T’d like to come.”\n“Well, come then.”\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as\nhe shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\n“T can’t doit—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he\nsaid.\n“‘There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over\nnow.”\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed\nup in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a\nyoung man it was different—if a friend of mine died,\nno matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 207\nmay think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the\nbitter end.”\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was de-\ntermined not to come, so I stood up.\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest\na “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my\nhand.\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man\nwhen he is alive and not after he is dead,” he sug-\ngested. “After that my own rule is to let everything\nalone.”\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and\nI got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing\nmy clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz\nwalking up and down excitedly in the hall. His\npride in his son and in his son’s possessions was con-\ntinually increasing and now he had something to\nshow me.\n‘Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his\nwallet with trembling fingers. “Look there.”\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the\ncorners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out\nevery detail to me eagerly. ‘Look there!” and then\nsought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it\nso often that I think it was more real to him now\nthan the house itself.\n‘Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty\npicture. It shows up well.”\n\n208 THE GREAT GATSBY\n“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”\n‘He come out to see me two years ago and bought\nme the house I live in now. Of course we was broke\nup when he run off from home, but I see now there\nwas a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in\nfront of him. And ever since he made a success he\nwas very generous with me.”\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held\nit for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes.\nThen he returned the wallet and pulled from his\npocket a ragged old copy of a book called “ Hop-\nalong Cassidy.”\n“‘Look here, this is a book he had when he was a\nboy. It just shows you.”\nHe opened it at the back cover and turned it\naround for me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed\nthe word SCHEDULE, and the date Septeraber 12,\n1906.

We see Gatsby's father's somber anticipation, the arrival of the Lutheran minister, and the poignant presence of the owl-eyed man (a recurring symbol of Gatsby's enigmatic world). The absence of Daisy's tribute highlights a key emotional void.\r\n* **Memory and Nostalgia:** The narrator vividly recalls Christmas train journeys back to his Midwest home, emphasizing sensory details (snow, sleigh bells, street lamps) and a deep-seated connection to place and youth. This contrasts with Gatsby's lavish but ultimately hollow world.\r\n* **Social Circles and Gatherings:**  References to parties (\"the Ordways', the Herseys', the Schultzes'\")  and the Union Street station bustling with farewells showcase the social dynamics of the era, hinting at Gatsby's attempts to recreate a sense of belonging through extravagant events.\r\n* **Isolation and Absence:** Despite Gatsby's wealth and pursuit of connection, themes of loneliness persist. Daisy's absence at the funeral underscores this, as does the owl-eyed man's solitary appearance and the narrator's reflection on Gatsby's ultimate detachment.\r\n\r\n**Extracted Entities (Specific Mentions):**\r\n\r\n* **People:** Gatsby, Gatsby's Father, Lutheran Minister from Flushing, Owl-Eyed Man, Daisy (implied), Narrator (Nick Carraway), Chicago friends,  individuals attending various holiday gatherings.\r\n* **Locations:** Cemetery, Gatsby's Mansion/Library (context from previous chapters), Union Street Station (Chicago), Midwest towns/rural areas, Carraway House (Narrator's home).\r\n* **Events:** Gatsby's Funeral, Christmas Train Journeys, Holiday Parties/Gatherings\r\n* **Objects/Symbols:** Motor Hearse,  Protective Canvas over Gatsby's Grave, Green Railroad Tickets, Fur Coats, Street Lamps, Sleigh Bells, Holly Wreaths, Snow\n\n\n**Relationship Mapping (Simplified):**\r\n* **Gatsby's Funeral**  <-- (connected to) **Isolation, Absence, Memory (Narrator's reflection)** \r\n* **Owl-Eyed Man**  <-- Symbol of Gatsby's enigmatic world, connected to **solitude and observation**\r\n* **Midwest Memories** <-- (contrast with) **Gatsby's World**  (emphasizing authenticity vs. artifice)\r\n* **Social Gatherings** <--  Illustrate attempts at connection within Gatsby's era, highlighting **underlying loneliness**\r\n* **Daisy's Absence** <--  Directly impacts understanding of Gatsby's emotional landscape and failed connections. \n",

I think\nhe rather expected me to copy down the list for my\nown use.\nA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived\nfrom Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily\nout the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby’s\nfather. And as the time passed and the servants\ncame in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes\nbegan to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain\nin a worried, uncertain way. The minister glanced\nseveral times at his watch, so I took him aside and\nasked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn’t\nany use.

As we started through the\ngate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the\nsound of some one splashing after us over the soggy\nground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-\neyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gats-\nby’s books in the library one night three months\nbefore.\nI'd never seen him since then. I don’t know how\nhe knew about the funeral, or even his name.

Dimly I heard some one\nmurmur ‘‘Blessed are the dead that the rain falls\non,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to\nthat,” in a brave voice.\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to\nthe cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.\n“T couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.\n“Neither could anybody else.”\n“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used\nto go there by the hundreds.”\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 211\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again,\noutside and in.\n“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.\nOne of my most vivid memories is of coming back\nWest from prep school and later from college at\nChristmas time. Those who went farther than\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Street\nstation at six o’clock of a December evening, with a\nfew Chicago friends, already caught up into their\nown holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by.\nI remember the fur coats of the girls returning from\nMiss This-or-That’s and the chatter of frozen breath\nand the hands waving overhead as we caught sight\nof old acquaintances, and the matchings of invita-\ntions: “‘Are you going to the Ordways’? the Her-\nseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets\nclasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the\nmurky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St.\nPaul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on\nthe tracks beside the gate.\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the\nreal snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us\nand twinkle against the windows, and the dim\nlights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp\nwild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in\ndeep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner\nthrough the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of\n\n212 THE GREAT GATSBY\nour identity with this country for one strange hour,\nbefore we melted indistinguishably into it again.\nThat’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the\nprairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling\nreturning trains of my youth, and the street lamps\nand sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows\nof holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the\nsnow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the\nfeel of those long winters, a little complacent from\ngrowing up in the Carraway house in a city where\ndwellings are still called\n######################\nOutput:"

Nick acknowledges her past influence on him.\r\n* **Tom Buchanan:** Aggressive, restless, involved in the Myrtle Wilson incident, reveals his actions to Nick under pressure.\r\n* **Myrtle Wilson (implied):**  Victim of the hit-and-run, Tom's affair with her was a key factor in the unfolding tragedy.  Wilson (her husband) is mentioned as seeking truth and driven to desperation.\r\n\r\n**Relationships & Dynamics:**\r\n* **Nick & Jordan:** Past romantic entanglement, now strained. Jordan's casual revelation of her engagement highlights the distance. Nick feels a mix of anger, lingering affection, and sadness.\r\n* **Nick & Tom:**  Antagonistic. Nick confronts Tom about his role in Myrtle's death, revealing their clashing perspectives and truths.\r\n* **Tom & Myrtle:**  Infidelity, a destructive secret affair at the heart of the tragedy. Tom's admission to Nick underscores the gravity of his involvement.\r\n* **Wilson & Myrtle:**  Husband and wife, deeply affected by the accident and Tom's deceit. Wilson's pursuit of truth points to tragic consequences.\r\n\r\n**Setting & Atmosphere:**\r\n* **Shifting Locations:**  Emphasis on \"West Egg\" (grotesque yet alluring), Fifth Avenue (urban confrontation), highlighting contrasting settings reflecting the narrative's complexities.\r\n* **Distortion & Memory:** Nick's perception of the East, especially after Gatsby's death, is skewed and haunting. This reflects the impact of events and his attempts to grapple with them.\r\n\r\n**Key Themes (Emerging):**\r\n* **Truth and Deception:**  The narrative revolves around uncovering hidden truths and the consequences of lies (Tom's actions, Jordan's casual approach).\r\n* **Social Decay & Illusion:** The glamorous facade of the Roaring Twenties masks darker realities (affairs, reckless behavior, shattered lives).\r\n* **Personal Responsibility & Regret:** Nick's journey involves confronting his own role and the weight of choices made amidst societal turmoil. \r\n\r\n**Next Passage Expectations:**  The excerpt likely delves deeper into Tom's confession, revealing further details about the Myrtle Wilson incident and its impact on the characters involved. Expect heightened tension and a progression towards resolving (or further complicating) the central conflicts.",

I am part of that, a little solemn with the\nfeel of those long winters, a little complacent from\ngrowing up in the Carraway house in a city where\ndwellings are still called through decades by a\nfamily’s name. I see now that this has been a story\nof the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we\npossessed some deficiency in common which made\nus subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\nEven when the East excited me most, even when\nI was most keenly aware of its superiority to the\nbored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio,\nwith their interminable inquisitions which spared\nonly the children and the very old—even then it\nhad always for me a quality of distortion. West\nEgg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a\nhundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque,\ncrouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a\nlustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn\nmen in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk\nwith a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 213\na white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles\nover the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely\nthe men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But\nno one knows the woman’s name, and no one\ncares.\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for\nme like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of\ncorrection. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves\nwas in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry\nstiff on the line I decided to come back home.\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an\nawkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better\nhave been let alone. But I wanted to leave things\nin order and not just trust that obliging and in-\ndifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan\nBaker and talked over and around what had hap-\npened to us together, and what had happened after-\nward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in\na big chair.\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember\nthinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin\nraised a little jauntily, her hair the color of an\nautumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the\nfingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished\nshe told me without comment that she was en-\ngaged to another man. I doubted that, though there\nwere several she could have married at a nod of her\nhead, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a\nminute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake,\n\n214 THE GREAT GATSBY\nthen I thought it all over again quickly and got up\nto say good-by.\n“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jor-\ndan suddenly. “‘ You threw me over on the telephone.\nI don’t give a damn about you now, but it was a\nnew experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for\na while.”\nWe shook hands.\n“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—‘a\nconversation we had once about driving a car?”\n“Why—not exactly.”\n“You said a bad driver was only safe until she\nmet another bad driver? Well, I met another bad\ndriver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of me to\nmake such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather\nan honest, straightforward person. I thought it was\nyour secret pride.”\n“T’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie\nto myself and call it honor.”\nShe didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with\nher, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Bu-\nchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth\nAvenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference,\nhis head moving sharply here and there, adapting\nitself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to\navoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning\n> be\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 215\ninto the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he\nsaw me and walked back, holding out his hand.\n“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to ,\nshaking hands with me?”\n“Yes. You know what I think of you.”\n“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy\nas hell. I don’t know what’s the matter with you.”\n“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson - ©\nthat afternoon?”\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I\nhad guessed right about those missing hours. I\nstarted to turn away, but he took a step after me\nand grabbed my arm.\n“T told him the truth,” he said. ‘‘He came to the\ndoor while we were getting ready to leave, and when\nI sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to\nforce his way up-stairs. He was crazy enough to\nkill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car.\nHis hand was on a revolver in his pocket every\nminute he was in the house—”\n######################\nOutput:"

He was crazy enough to\nkill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car.\nHis hand was on a revolver in his pocket every\nminute he was in the house—” He broke off de-\nfiantly. “‘What if I did tell him? That fellow had\nit coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes\njust like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough one.\nHe ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and\nnever even stopped his car.”\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one un-\nutterable fact that it wasn’t true.\n“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffer-\ning—look here, when I went to give up that flat\n\n216 THE GREAT GATSBY\nand saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there\non the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby.\nBy God it was awful——”\n1 couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that\nwhat he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It\nwas all very careless and confused. They were care-\nless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up\nthings and creatures and then retreated back into\ntheir money or their vast carelessness, or whatever\nit was that kept them together, and let other people\nclean up the mess they had made. ...\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for\nI felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.\nThen he went into the jewelry store to buy a\npearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff but-\ntons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.\nGatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the\ngrass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One\nof the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare\npast the entrance gate without stopping for a min-\nute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove\nDaisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the\naccident, and perhaps he had made a story about\nit all his own.

Probably it was some final guest who had\nbeen away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know\nthat the party was over.\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my\ncar sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at\nthat huge incoherent failure of a house once more.\nOn the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by\nsome boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in\nthe moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe\nraspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down\nto the beach and sprawled out on the sand.\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and\nthere were hardly any lights except the shadowy,\nmoving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And\nas the moon rose higher the inessential houses began\nto melt away until gradually I became aware of\nthe old island here that flowered once for Dutch\nsailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world.\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for\nGatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to\nthe last and greatest of all human dreams; for a\ntransitory enchanted moment man must have held\nhis breath in the presence of this continent, com-\npelled into an esthetic contemplation he neither un-\nderstood nor desired, face to face for the last time\n\n218 THE GREAT GATSBY\nin history with something commensurate to his\ncapacity for wonder.\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown\nworld, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first\npicked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock.\nHe had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his\ndream must have seemed so close that he could\nhardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it\nwas already behind him, somewhere back in that\nvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark\nfields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic\nfuture that year by year recedes before us. It eluded\nus then, but that’s no matter—to-morrow we will\nrun faster, stretch out our arms farther. ... And\none fine morning——\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne\nback ceaselessly into the past.\n######################\nOutput:"

The atmosphere is a mix of polite social convention and underlying tensions.\\r\\n* **Key Themes/Plot Points (Emerging):**\\r\\n    * **Social Decay and Superficiality:**  Conversations touch on \\\"civilization going to pieces,\\\" with Tom espousing racist and pseudoscientific ideas about racial dominance. Daisy and Miss Baker engage in seemingly light banter masking a deeper unease.\\r\\n    * **Power Dynamics and Manipulation:** Tom asserts his dominance through opinions and narratives, while Daisy subtly plays along or offers veiled dissent (like the \\\"wink\\\" and mentioning a family secret).\\r\\n    * **Hidden Truths and Secrets:**  Daisy's whisper about the butler's nose hints at a desire to share something intimate and perhaps scandalous, adding a layer of intrigue.\\r\\n    * **Contrasts and Irony:** The discussion of  \\\"the longest day\\\" juxtaposed with their awareness of time passing quickly and casually emphasizes a sense of emptiness or missed opportunities.\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\\" **Specific Entity Analysis and Connections'')**\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Daisy Buchanan:** Appears both compliant and subtly rebellious. Her \\\"unthoughtful sadness,\\\" winks, and interest in sharing a secret suggest a complex personality navigating societal expectations and personal truths.\\r\\n* **Tom Buchanan:**  Driven by a flawed sense of superiority rooted in racial theories and a need to control narratives. His insistence on scientific justification highlights his intellectual posturing while masking insecurity.\\r\\n* **Miss Baker:**  Embodies the cool detachment often associated with the social elite. Her casual remarks and acceptance of the situation point to a weariness with pretense.\\r\\n* **Narrator (Nick):** Acts as an observer, drawn into their world but slightly alienated. His questions about \\\"crops\\\" reveal a yearning for genuineness amidst the artifice.\\r\\n* **Butler (Symbolic):**  His nose becomes a symbol of a hidden story, representing unspoken truths and perhaps the vulnerability behind the facade of wealth and power. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Continuing Narrative Trajectory:**  The excerpt sets up a tension between outward appearances and underlying currents of dissatisfaction, racism, and veiled secrets. Expect further exploration of these themes as Daisy's secret unfolds and interactions reveal deeper character motivations.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all\\njudgments, a habit that has opened up many curi-\\nous natures to me and also made me the victim of\\nnot a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is\\nquick to detect and attach itself to this quality\\nwhen it appears in a normal person, and so it came\\nabout that in college I was unjustly accused of\\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret\\ngriefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences\\nwere unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,\\npreoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation\\nwas quivering on the horizon; for the intimate\\nrevelations of young men, or at least the terms in\\nI\\n\\n2 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nwhich they express them, are usually plagiaristic\\nand marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving\\njudgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a\\nlittle afraid of missing something if I forget that, as\\nmy father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is par-\\ncelled out unequally at birth.\\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I\\ncome to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct\\nmay be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes,\\nbut after a certain point I don’t care what it’s\\nfounded on. When I came back from the East last\\nautumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in\\nuniform and at a sort of moral attention forever;\\nI wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged\\nglimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the\\nman who gives his name to this book, was exempt\\nfrom my reaction—Gatsby, who represented every-\\nthing for which I have an unaffected scorn. If per-\\nsonality is an unbroken series of successful gestures,\\nthen there was something gorgeous about him, some\\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if\\nhe were related to one of those intricate machines\\nthat register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.\\nThis responsiveness had nothing to do with that\\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the\\nname of the ‘creative temperament”—it was an\\nextraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness\\nsuch as I have never found in any other person and\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 3\\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—\\nGatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what\\npreyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the\\nwake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\\ninterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded\\nelations of men.\\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do peo-\\nple in this Middle Western city for three generations.\\nThe Carraways are something of a clan, and we have\\na tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes\\nof Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was\\nmy grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-\\none, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started\\nthe wholesale hardware business that my father car-\\nries on to-day.\\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to\\nlook like him—with special reference to the rather\\nhard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office.\\nI graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quar-\\nter of a century after my father, and al ittle later I\\nparticipated in that delayed Teutonic migration\\nknown as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-\\nraid so thoroughly that I came back restless. In-\\nstead of being the warm centre of the world, the\\nMiddle West now seemed like the ragged edge of\\nthe universe—so I decided to go East and learn the\\nbond business.

Nick acknowledges Gatsby's captivating aura despite his scorn for Gatsby's \\\"type.\\\" \\r\\n    * **\\\"Gorgeousness\\\" & Heightened Sensitivity:**  Gatsby embodies a romantic hopefulness and connection to life's possibilities, unlike ordinary men.\\r\\n    * **Mysterious Past & Dreams:** Gatsby's backstory and the \\\"foul dust\\\" haunting his dreams pique Nick's curiosity, suggesting a complex narrative unfolding.\\r\\n* **Family Background (Carraways):**  Established as prominent, traditional, and with a lineage tied to wealth and business. This contrasts with Gatsby's undefined origins, adding to the tension.\\r\\n    * **Emphasis on Legacy & Security:** Nick's upbringing emphasizes stability and inherited success, a world different from Gatsby's pursuit.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Emerging Themes:**\\r\\n\\r\\n* **The American Dream & Illusion:** Gatsby's character foreshadows a complex exploration of chasing aspirations, wealth, and love in a society marked by disparity.\\r\\n* **Past vs. Present:** Nick's reflection on his \\\"younger and more vulnerable years\\\" and the yearning for a simpler world set against the backdrop of post-war disillusionment.\\r\\n* **Social Classes & Perception:**  The contrast between Nick's established family and Gatsby's enigmatic persona hints at societal divisions and judgments based on Herkunft (origin).\\r\\n* **Hope & Disillusionment:** While Nick initially seeks order, Gatsby embodies a potent hopefulness that both attracts and perplexes him, suggesting a central conflict within the novel. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Narrative Style:**  First-person narration allows for intimate insights into Nick's thoughts and gradual unveiling of the Gatsby enigma.

He thinks she goes to see her sister in\\nNew York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s\\nalive.”\\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up to-\\ngether to New York—or not quite together, tor Mrs.\\nWilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred\\nthat much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers\\nwho might be on the train.\\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured\\nmuslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide\\nhips as Tom helped her to the platform in New\\nYork. At the news-stand she bought a copy of Town\\nTattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the\\nstation drug-store some cold cream and a small\\n\\n32 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nflask of perfume. Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing\\ndrive she let four taxicabs drive away before she\\nselected a new one, lavender-colored with gray up-\\nholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of\\nthe station into the glowing sunshine. But im-\\nmediately she turned sharply from the window and,\\nleaning forward, tapped on the front glass.\\n“T want to get one of those dogs,” she said ear-\\nnestly. ‘I want to get one forthe apartment. They’re\\nnice to have—a dog.”\\nWe backed up to a gray old man who bore an\\nabsurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a\\nbasket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very\\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson\\neagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.\\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\\n*1’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t\\nsuppose you got that kind?”\\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket,\\nplunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling,\\nby the back of the neck.\\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man\\nwith disappointment in his voice. ‘‘It’s more of an\\nAiredale.”’ He passed his hand over the brown wash-\\nrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat.\\nThat’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching\\ncold.”\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 33\\n“T think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusias-\\ntically. “How much is it?”\\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That\\ndog will cost you ten dollars.”\\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale\\nconcerned in it somewhere, though its feet were\\nstartlingly white—changed hands and settled down\\ninto Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weather-\\nproof coat with rapture.\\n“Ts it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. ‘“‘Here’s your\\nmoney. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.”\\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft,\\nalmost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon.\\nI wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock\\nof white sheep turn the corner.\\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you\\nhere.”\\n“No, you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly.\\n“Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the\\napartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\\n“Come on,” she urged. “‘I’ll telephone my sister\\nCatherine. She’s said to be very beautiful by peo-\\nple who ought to know.”\\n“Well, I'd like to, but——”\\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park\\ntoward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the\\ncab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\\n\\n34 THE GREAT GATSBY\\napartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming\\nglance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gath-\\nered up her dog and her other purchases, and went\\nhaughtily in.\\n“Ym going to have the McKees come up,” she\\nannounced as we rose in the elevator. “And, of\\ncourse, I got to call up my sister, too.”\\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small\\nliving-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom,\\nand a bath. The living-room was crowded to the\\ndoors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too\\nlarge for it, so that to move about was to stumble\\ncontinually over scenes of ladies swinging in the\\ngardens of Versailles.

Daisy was my second cousin once\\nremoved, and I’d known Tom in college. And just af-\\nter the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\\nHer husband, among various physical accomplish-\\nments, had been one of the most powerful ends that\\never played football at New Haven—a national fig-\\nure in a way, one of those men who reach such an\\nacute limited excellence at twenty-one that every-\\nthing afterward savors of anti-climax.

Not\\neven the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could\\nhide the enormous power of that body—he seemed\\nto fill those glistening boots until he strained the\\ntop lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle\\nshifting when his shoulder moved under his thin\\ncoat.

Their stillness and white attire create a contrast with the dynamic windswept environment, emphasizing their passivity within Tom's world.\\r\\n* **Nick Carraway (Narrator):** Observant, somewhat detached, acts as a lens through which we perceive Tom and the atmosphere. He picks up on subtle cues and undercurrents in their interactions.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Setting & Atmosphere:**\\r\\n* **East Egg Mansion:** Extravagant, meticulously designed (\\\"cheerful red-and-white... Georgian Colonial\\\"), showcasing wealth and a sense of staged perfection. The sprawling lawn and gardens emphasize vastness and a carefully cultivated image.\\r\\n* **Dynamic Wind:**  A constant presence, whipping curtains, rugs, and embodying a restless energy that contrasts with the static figures (especially the women on the divan). This reflects the underlying tension and unspoken currents within the house.\\r\\n* **Sensory Details:** Vivid descriptions (glowing windows, pungent roses, wine-colored rug) create a lush but slightly unsettling ambiance.  The \\\"boom\\\" of closed windows silencing the wind adds a layer of control and suppression.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Themes Emerging (Early in the Narrative):**\\r\\n* **Wealth and Illusion:**  The ostentatious setting masks deeper complexities and possibly emptiness within the characters' lives. Tom's pursuit of past glories hints at dissatisfaction beneath the surface.\\r\\n* **Masculinity and Power:** Tom's physical presence, assertive voice, and manner project dominance. His need to assert himself (even subtly) creates an undercurrent of tension.\\r\\n* **Passivity vs. Action:** The contrasting images of the windswept environment and the motionless women on the divan suggest a dichotomy –  external movement versus internal stillness, hinting at societal roles and constraints.\\r\\n* **Hidden Depths:** Nick's observant narration implies that appearances conceal much.  The true nature of relationships (Tom/Daisy, Tom/Nick) and their motivations remain to be fully explored. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Overall Impression:** The passage sets a stage rich in symbolism and foreshadowing, promising a narrative delving into the complexities of wealth, masculinity, and the facade of perfection in the Jazz Age.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Then there was a boom as\\nTom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the\\ncaught wind died out about the room, and the cur-\\ntains and the rugs and the two young women bal-\\nlooned slowly to the floor.\\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me.\\nShe was extended full length at her end of the\\ndivan, completely motionless, and with her chin\\nraised al ittle, as if she were balancing something on\\nit which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out\\nof the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—\\nindeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an\\napology for having disturbed her by coming in.\\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—\\nshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious ex-\\npression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming\\nlittle laugh, and I laughed too and came forward\\ninto the room.\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY II\\n“Tm p-paralyzed with happiness.”\\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very\\nwitty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up\\ninto my face, promising that there was no one in\\nthe world she so much wanted to see. That was a\\nway she had. She hinted in a murmur that the sur-\\nname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve heard\\nit said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people\\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made\\nit no less charming.)\\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nod-\\nded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly\\ntipped her head back again—the object she was bal-\\nancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\\nsomething of a fright. Again a sort of apology\\narose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete\\nself-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me\\nquestions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the\\nkind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as\\nif each speech is an arrangement of notes that will\\nnever be played again. Her face was sad and lovely\\nwith bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright\\npassionate mouth, but there was an excitement in\\nher voice that men who had cared for her found\\ndifficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered\\n“Listen,” a promise that she had done gay, excit-\\ning things just a while since and that there were\\ngay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.\\n\\n12 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a\\nday on my way East, and how a dozen people had\\nsent their love through me.\\n“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.\\n“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have\\nthe left rear wheel painted black as a mourning\\nwreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along\\nthe north shore.”\\n“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. To-mor-\\nrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to\\nsee the baby.”\\n“T’d like to.”\\n“‘She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t\\nyou ever seen her?”\\n“Never.”\\n“Well, you ought to see her. She’s——”’\\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly\\nabout the room, stopped and rested his hand on my\\nshoulder.\\n“What you doing, Nick?”\\n“T’m a bond man.”\\n‘Who with?”\\nI told him.\\n“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.\\nThis annoyed me.\\n“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you\\nstay in the East.”\\n“Oh, T’ll stay in tne East, don’t you worry,” he\\nsaid, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 13\\nhe were alert for something more. “I’d be a God\\ndamned fool to live anywhere else.”\\nAt this point Miss Baker said: ‘‘ Absolutely !” with\\nsuch suddenness that I started—it was the first\\nword she had uttered since I came into the room.\\nEvidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for\\nshe yawned and with a series of rapid, deft move-\\nments stood up into the room.\\n“T’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on\\nthat sofa for as long as I can remember.”\\n“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been\\ntrying to get you to New York all afternoon.”\\n\\\" “No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cock-\\ntails just in from the pantry, “I’m absolutely in\\ntraining.”\\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\\n“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were\\na drop in the bottom of a glass. ‘How you ever get\\nanything done is beyond me.”\\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was\\nshe “got done.” I enjoyed looking at her. She was\\na slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect car-\\nriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body\\nbackward at the shoulders like a young cadet.\\nHer gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with\\npolite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charm-\\ning, discontented face.

He feels a sense of awe and slight confusion regarding Daisy's captivating aura and Miss Baker's enigmatic actions.\\r\\n* **Daisy Buchanan (Central Figure, Alluring & Complex):**  Charming, emotionally expressive, hints at a past filled with excitement (\\\"gay, exciting things\\\"). Possesses a magnetic quality that draws attention and fuels speculation. Her voice is described as alluring and hinting at hidden depths.\\r\\n* **Tom Buchanan (Powerful, Aloof):** Daisy's husband, appears dominant and restless. Shows disinterest in Nick's profession initially but asserts his permanence in the East, emphasizing his societal standing. \\r\\n* **Miss Baker (Mysterious & Witty):**  Initially silent and seemingly balanced (both literally and metaphorically), she suddenly interjects with surprising directness.  Her aloof demeanor contrasts with Daisy's openness, adding an element of intrigue. Described as slender, with a sharp intellect and a touch of cynicism (\\\"contemptuously\\\" about West Egg).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Relationships & Dynamics:**\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Daisy & Nick:** A clear attraction and fascination from Nick towards Daisy's captivating personality. Their conversation reveals a closeness built on shared experiences and implied secrets.\\r\\n* **Daisy & Tom:**  A complex marriage hinted at through their interactions. Tom appears possessive and in control, while Daisy expresses longing for a different life (\\\"go back to...tomorrow!\\\"). \\r\\n* **Miss Baker & Social Circle:**  She holds a unique position, observant yet detached. Her comment about West Egg suggests knowledge and perhaps subtle judgment within this elite social circle.\\r\\n* **Narrator's Role (Nick):** Acts as a lens through which we perceive these relationships, highlighting the complexities and unspoken currents flowing beneath the surface glamour. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Themes Emerging:**\\r\\n    * **Social Dynamics & Appearances:** The lavish setting and carefully crafted personas reveal a society obsessed with image and hidden truths.\\r\\n    * **Feminine Allure & Power:** Both Daisy and Miss Baker, though different in expression, wield a captivating influence within this male-dominated world.\\r\\n    * **Longing & Escapism:**  Hints of dissatisfaction and a desire for something more genuine underlie the superficiality.\\r\\n    * **Observation & Interpretation:** Nick's role as narrator emphasizes the novel's exploration of understanding human behavior through subtle cues and interactions. \\n\\n\\n**Further Analysis (Based on Context):**\\r\\nThe passage sets the stage for exploring  contrasts and tensions within the \\\"Jazz Age\\\" society. While glamour and wealth are apparent,  undercurrents of restlessness, yearning, and unspoken desires simmer beneath. Miss Baker's sudden entrance and enigmatic remarks foreshadow her potential as a disruptor to established norms and perceptions within this social fabric. Her connection to West Egg adds another layer of intrigue, hinting at possible alternative narratives or viewpoints existing outside the immediate circle.  Nick, as our guide, is poised to unravel these complexities further.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.  Add them below using the same format:\n"

Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.\\n“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we\\ngroaned down in the elevator.\\n“Where?”\\n“‘A nywhere.”\\n“‘Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the ele-\\nvator boy.\\n“JT beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dig-\\nnity, “I didn’t know I was touching it.”\\n“All right,” I agreed, “I'll be glad to.”\\n. .. | was standing beside his bed and he was sit-\\nting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear,\\nwith a great portfolio in his hands.\\n“Beauty and the Beast . . .

In his blue gardens men and\\ngirls came and went like moths among the whisper-\\nings and the champagne and the stars. At high\\ntide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving\\nfrom the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the\\nhot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit\\nthe waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over\\ncataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce\\nbecame an omnibus, bearing parties to and from\\nthe city between nine in the morning and long past\\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a\\nbrisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mon-\\ndays eight servants, including an extra gardener,\\ntoiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and\\nhammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages\\nof the night before.\\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons\\narrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Mon-\\nday these same oranges and lemons left his back\\ndoor in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a\\nmachine in the kitchen which could extract the\\njuice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a\\nlittle button was pressed two hundred times by a\\nbutler’s thumb.\\n47\\n\\n48 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came\\ndown with several hundred feet of canvas and\\nenough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of\\nGatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, gar-\\nnished with glistening hors-d’ceuvre, spiced baked\\nhams crowded against salads of harlequin designs\\nand pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark\\ngold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail\\nwas set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and\\nwith cordials so long forgotten that most of his\\nfemale guests were too young to know one from\\nanother.\\nBy seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no\\nthin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and\\ntrombones and saxophones and viols and cornets\\nand piccolos, and low and high drums. The last\\nswimmers have come in from the beach now and\\nare dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are\\nparked five deep in the drive, and already the\\nhalls and salons and verandas are gaudy with\\nprimary colors, and hair bobbed in strange new\\nways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.\\nThe bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of\\ncocktails permeate the garden outside, until the\\nair is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual\\ninnuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot,\\nand enthusiastic meetings between women who\\nnever knew each other’s names.\\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 49\\naway from the sun, and now the orchestra is play-\\ning yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices\\npitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by\\nminute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a\\ncheerful word. The groups change more swiftly,\\nswell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\\nsame breath; already there are wanderers, confident\\ngirls who weave here and there among the stouter\\nand more stable, become for a sharp, joyous mo-\\nment the centre of a group, and then, excited with\\ntriumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"## Entity Recognition and Relationships from The Great Gatsby Passage:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Characters:**\\r\\n* **Narrator (Nick Carraway):**  Direct participant, observer, and narrator of events.\\r\\n* **Jay Gatsby:**  Wealthy host, center of extravagant parties, implied mysterious past.\\r\\n* **Mr. McKee:**  Introduced character attending a party, interacts with the Narrator.\\r\\n* **Female Guests:**  Numerous at Gatsby's parties, described as bobbed hair, vibrant attire.\\r\\n* **Servants (implied):**  Eight mentioned, maintain Gatsby's mansion and grounds.\\r\\n* **Elevator Boy:**  Brief interaction with Mr. McKee.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Locations & Settings:**\\r\\n* **Gatsby's Mansion:**  Site of lavish parties, described with blue gardens, raft, beach, etc.\\r\\n* **Pennsylvania Station:**  Where Narrator briefly waits for a train.\\r\\n* **City (New York):** Implied as origin/destination for Gatsby's guests and supplies.\\r\\n* **Gatsby's Garden:**  Central to parties, adorned with lights, buffet tables, orchestra.\\r\\n* **Bars & Salons:**  Within Gatsby's mansion, bustling with activity during parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Events & Actions:**\\r\\n* **Parties:** Frequent, extravagant affairs at Gatsby's mansion with music, alcohol, dancing.\\r\\n* **Arrival/Departure of Guests:**  Constant flow using Rolls-Royce, station wagon, trains.\\r\\n* **Preparation & Cleanup:**  Servants working diligently between parties.\\r\\n* **Narrator's Observations:**  He witnesses and describes the atmosphere, interactions, and opulence.\\r\\n* **Music & Entertainment:**  Live orchestra, cocktail music, creating a lively ambiance.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Relationships & Dynamics:**\\r\\n* **Gatsby as Host:** Controls the lavish spectacle, attracts diverse guests.\\r\\n* **Guests' Social Interactions:** Fluid groupings, casual conversations, fleeting connections.\\r\\n* **Narrator as Outsider:**  Observant participant, capturing the essence but not fully integrated.\\r\\n* **Service & Consumption:**  Emphasis on caterers, elaborate food, highlighting Gatsby's wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Themes (Emerging):**\\r\\n* **Wealth & Excess:** Gatsby's parties epitomize extravagant display of riches.\\r\\n* **Social Fluidity & Superficiality:**  Transient connections, emphasis on appearance.\\r\\n* **The American Dream & Its Illusion:**  Gatsby's pursuit hinted at, but clouded by opulence.\\r\\n* **Observation & Narration:**  Narrator's role in unveiling the complexities beneath the surface. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Note:** This analysis continues to evolve as the text progresses, revealing deeper layers and connections within the narrative.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Adds layer of marital & socioeconomic entanglement within the desolate setting.\r\n* **Myrtle Wilson:** Though not physically present, her name and connection to George, *and* the Valley of Ashes, underscore  her role in this world's dynamics (unfulfilled desires, trapped circumstances).\r\n* **Immigrant Workers (Unspecified):**  Implied presence amongst the ash-gray men, highlighting the marginalized labor force shaping this landscape.\r\n\r\n**Locations & Settings ( Refined):**\r\n* **Wilson's Garage:**  Specific location within the Valley of Ashes, symbolizing meager existence and anchoring George Wilson's story.\r\n* **\"Eyesight Testing Place\" (Mentioned):** Adds a layer of ironic commentary -  claiming to offer clarity while situated amidst visual decay and societal blindness.\r\n\r\n**Objects & Symbols (Expanded):**\r\n* **Gray Dust that Covers Everything:**  Not merely ash, but a pervasive element choking life and representing the all-encompassing influence of industrialization's blight.\r\n* **Cheap Jewelry & Dresses (Myrtle's Realm):**  Symbols of aspiration and fleeting luxury within a context of poverty, hinting at Myrtle's desires and compromised reality.\r\n* **Forgotten Prayers & Sermons (Implied):**  The Valley's atmosphere suggests eroded faith and moral compass, contrasting with Doctor Eckleburg's watchful eyes.\r\n\r\n**Relationships & Atmosphere (Deeper Connections):**\r\n* **Entangled Destinies:**  George and Myrtle's lives, though seemingly separate from Gatsby's, are woven into the fabric of this decaying world, foreshadowing interconnected tragedies.\r\n* **Broken Dreams & Aspirations:**  Myrtle's yearning for a different life reflects a broader societal theme – the pursuit of illusory happiness amidst hardship.\r\n* **Moral Vacuum:** The Valley of Ashes embodies a space where traditional values and religion seem powerless, replaced by a sense of detached observation (Eckleburg's eyes) and grasping for fleeting pleasures.\r\n* **Undercurrent of Violence & Fate:**  The heightened atmosphere hints at simmering tensions and foreshadows eventual eruptions of conflict within this confined world.\n\n\n\nBy incorporating these additional entities and connections, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex web of relationships, symbolism, and foreshadowing present in Chapter II's depiction of the Valley of Ashes.",

Evidently some wild wag of an\\noculist set them there to fatten his practice in the\\n27\\n\\n28 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nborough of Queens, and then sank down himself\\ninto eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved\\naway. But his eyes, dimmed al ittle by many paint-\\nless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the\\nsolemn dumping ground.\\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a\\nsmall foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up\\nto let barges through, the passengers on waiting\\ntrains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as\\nhalf an hour.

Though\\nI was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her\\n—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on\\nthe train one afternoon, and when we stopped by\\nthe ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold\\nof my elbow, literally forced me from the car.\\n“We're getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to\\nmeet my girl.”\\nI think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and\\nhis determination to have my company bordered\\non violence. The supercilious assumption was that\\non Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\\nI followed him over a low whitewashed railroad\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 29\\nfence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the\\nroad under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The\\nonly building in sight was a small block of yellow\\nbrick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of\\ncompact Main Street ministering to it, and contigu-\\nous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it\\ncontained was for rent and another was an all-night\\nrestaurant, approached bya t rail of ashes; the third\\nwas a garage—Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars\\nbought and sold.—and I followed Tom inside.\\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only\\ncar visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford\\nwhich crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to\\nme that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and\\nthat sumptuous and romantic apartments were con-\\ncealed overhead, when the proprietor himself ap-\\npeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\\non a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man,\\nanemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us\\na damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue\\neyes.\\n“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping\\nhim jovially on the shoulder. ‘‘How’s business?”\\n“T can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvinc-\\ningly. ‘When are you going to sell me that car?”\\n“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it\\nnow.”\\n“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”\\n““No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. ‘‘And if you\\n\\n30 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nfeel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it some-\\nwhere else after all.”\\n“T don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly.\\n“T just meant——”\\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently\\naround the garage.

Crucial for understanding the story's lens.\r\n    * **Jordan Baker:**  Introduced as a golfer and Nick's acquaintance, adding a layer of female perspective within this social circle. Initially portrayed as cool and observant.\r\n    * **George Wilson (Absent but Implied):**  Though not physically present, Mrs. Wilson's mentions of him and their business foreshadow his significance in the larger narrative and its tragic undercurrents.\r\n    * **Jay Gatsby (Shadow Presence):**  Though unseen, Gatsby's lavish mansion and the constant buzz surrounding him create a magnetic pull on this gathering, making him a central *absent* character.\r\n\r\n* **Setting nuances:**  The \"apartment over a garage\" adds a layer of social stratification –  luxury juxtaposed with less glamorous origins, hinting at complexities within Gatsby's world.\r\n* **Themes (Further Development):**\r\n    * **Class & Illusion:**  The gathering exposes the blurred lines between wealth and pretense. While extravagant, there's an underlying sense of insecurity and striving for acceptance within specific social circles.\r\n    * **Gossip & Networks:** Conversations revolve around snippets of information (\"Gatsby's parties,\" rumors about people), highlighting the interconnectedness and reliance on hearsay in this society.\r\n    * **Morality & Compromise:**  Subtle hints at infidelity (Tom, Mrs. Wilson) and the casual acceptance of such actions reveal a moral ambiguity prevalent within the Jazz Age.\r\n\r\n* **Narrative Technique:**  Increased use of *indirect characterization* (through dialogue, observations, and reactions) allows for deeper psychological readings as the story unfolds.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating these additions, we gain a more holistic view of the social web, foreshadowing, and thematic undercurrents at play in \"The Great Gatsby\" within this pivotal scene.",

Looked at from a distance, how-\\never, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the\\ncountenance of a stout old lady beamed down into\\nthe room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on\\nthe table together with a copy of “Simon Called\\nPeter,”’ and some of the small scandal magazines of\\nBroadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with\\nthe dog. A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box\\nfull of straw and some milk, to which he added on\\nhis own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits—\\none of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer\\nof milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out\\na bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.\\nI have been drunk just twice in my life, and the\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 35\\nsecond time was that afternoon; so everything that\\nhappened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although\\nuntil after eight o’clock the apartment was full of\\ncheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson\\ncalled up several people on the telephone; then there\\nwere no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at\\nthe drugstore on the corner. When I came back\\nthey had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly\\nin the living-room and read a chapter of “Simon\\nCalled Peter”—either it was terrible stuff or the\\nwhiskey distorted things, because it didn’t make\\nany sense to me.\\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs.\\nWilson and I called each other by our first names)\\nreappeared, company commenced to arrive at the\\napartment-door.\\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl\\nof about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair,\\nand a complexion powdered milky white. Her eye-\\nbrows had been plucked and then drawn on again\\nat a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature\\ntoward the restoration of the old alignment gave a\\nblurred air to her face. When she moved about\\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pot-\\ntery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.\\nShe came in with such a proprietary haste, and\\nlooked around so possessively at the furniture that\\nI wondered if she lived here.

He informed me that he was in the “‘artistic\\ngame,” and I gathered later that he was a photog-\\nrapher and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs.\\nWilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm\\non the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome,\\nand horrible. She told me with pride that her hus-\\nband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-\\nseven times since they had been married.\\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time\\nbefore, and was now attired in an elaborate after-\\nnoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out\\na continual rustle as she swept about the room.\\nWith the influence of the dress her personality had\\nalso undergone a change.

A momentary\\nhush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm oblig-\\ningly for her, and there is a burst of chatter as the\\nerroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s\\nunderstudy from the Follies. The party has begun.\\nI believe that on the first night I went to Gats-\\nby’s house I was one of the few guests who had\\nactually been invited. People were not invited—\\nthey went there. They got into automobiles which\\nbore them out to Long Island, and somehow they\\nended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were\\nintroduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and\\nafter that they conducted themselves according to\\n\\n50 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nthe rules of behavior associated with an amusement\\npark. Sometimes they came and went without hav-\\ning met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a\\nsimplicity of heart that was its own ticket of ad-\\nmission.\\nI had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a\\nuniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early\\nthat Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal\\nnote from his employer: the honor would be entirely\\nGatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his “little party”\\nthat night. He had seen me several times, and had\\nintended to call on me long before, but a peculiar\\ncombination of circumstances had prevented it—\\nsigned Jay Gatsby, in a majestic hand.\\nDressed up in white flannels I went over to his\\nlawn a little after seven, and wandered around\\nrather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people\\nI didn’t know—though here and there was a face\\nI had noticed on the commuting train.

I was sure that\\nthey were selling something: bonds or insurance or\\nautomobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware\\nof the easy money in the vicinity and convinced\\nthat it was theirs for a few words in the right\\nkey.\\nAs soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 51\\nmy host, but the two or three people of whom I\\nasked his whereabouts stared at me in such an\\namazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowl-\\nedge of his movements, that I slunk off in the direc-\\ntion of the cocktail table—the only place in the\\ngarden where a single man could linger without\\nlooking purposeless and alone.\\nI was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer\\nembarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the\\nhouse and stood at the head of the marble steps,\\nleaning a little backward and looking with contemp-\\ntuous interest down into the garden.\\nWelcome or not, I found it necessary to attach\\nmyself to some one before I should begin to address\\ncordial remarks to the passers-by.\\n“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My\\nvoice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.\\n“T thought you might be here,” she responded\\nabsently as I came up. “I remembered you lived\\nnext door to——”’\\nShe held my hand impersonally, as a promise that\\nshe’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to\\ntwo girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at\\nthe foot of the steps.\\n“Hello!” they cried together. ‘Sorry you didn’t\\nwin.”\\nThat was for the golf tournament.

With Jordan’s slender golden\\narm resting in mine, we descended the steps and\\nsauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails\\nfloated at us through the twilight, and we sat down\\nat a table with the two girls in yellow and three\\nmen, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.\\n“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired\\nJordan of the girl beside her.\\n“The last one was the one I met you at,” an-\\nswered the girl, in an alert confident voice. She\\nturned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you,\\nLucille?”\\nIt was for Lucille, too.\\n“T like to come,”’ Lucille said. ‘I never care what\\nI do, so I always have a good time.

A sudden empti-\\nness seemed to flow now from the windows and the\\ngreat doors, endowing with complete isolation the\\nfigure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand\\nup in a formal gesture of farewell.\\nReading over what I have written so far, I see I\\nhave given the impression that the events of three\\nnights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me.\\nOn the contrary, they were merely casual events\\nin a crowded summer, and, until much later, they\\nabsorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning\\nthe sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried\\ndown the white chasms of lower New York to the\\nProbity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young\\nbond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched\\nwith them in dark, crowded restaurants on little\\npig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I\\neven had a short affair with a girl who lived in\\nJersey City and worked in the accounting depart-\\nment, but her brother began throwing mean looks\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 69\\nin my direction, so when she went on her vacation\\nin July I let it blow quietly away.\\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some\\nreason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and\\nthen I went up-stairs to the library and studied in-\\nvestments and securities for a conscientious hour.\\nThere were generally a few rioters around, but they\\nnever came into the library, so it was a good place\\nto work. After that, if the night was mellow, I\\nstrolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray\\nHill Hotel, and over 33d Street to the Pennsylvania\\nStation.\\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous\\nfeel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the con-\\nstant flicker of men and women and machines gives\\nto the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue\\nand pick out romantic women from the crowd and\\nimagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter\\ninto their lives, and no one would ever know or dis-\\napprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them\\nto their apartments on the corners of hidden streets,\\nand they turned and smiled back at me before they\\nfaded through a door into warm darkness. At the\\nenchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting\\nloneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor\\nyoung clerks who loitered in front of windows wait-\\ning until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner\\n—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poign-\\nant moments of night and life.\\n\\n70 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nAgain at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the\\nForties were lined five deep with throbbing taxi-\\ncabs, bound for the theatre\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"##  Analysis and Entities from The Great Gatsby Passage:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Characters & Relationships (Direct & Implied):**\\r\\n* **Narrator (Nick Carraway):**  Central figure, observant, introspective.

Forms leaned together in the taxis as\\nthey waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter\\nfrom unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes made un-\\nintelligible circles inside. Imagining that I, too, was\\nhurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate\\nexcitement, I wished them well.\\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then\\nin midsummer I found her again. At first I was\\nflattered to go places with her, because she was a\\ngolf champion, and every one knew her name.\\nThen it was something more. I wasn’t actually in\\nlove, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The pored\\nhaughty face that she turned to the world concealed\\nsomething—most affectations conceal something\\neventually, even though they don’t in the beginning\\n—and one day I found what it was. When we were\\non a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\\nborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and\\nthen lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the\\nstory about her that had eluded me that night at\\nDaisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a\\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers—a sugges-\\ntion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in\\nthe semi-final round. The thing approached the\\nproportions of a scandal—then died away. A\\ncaddy retracted his statement, and the only other\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 71\\nwitness admitted that he might have been mis-\\ntaken. The incident and the name had remained\\ntogether in my mind.\\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd\\nmen, and now I saw that this was because she felt\\nsafer on a plane where any divergence from a code\\nwould be thought impossible. She was incurably\\ndishonest. She wasn’t able to endure being at a\\ndisadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I sup-\\npose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent\\nsmile turned to the world and yet satisfy the de-\\nmands of her hard, jaunty body.\\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a\\nwoman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was\\ncasually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that\\nsame house party that we had a curious conversa-\\ntion about driving a car. It started because she\\npassed so close to some workmen that our fender\\nflicked a button on one man’s coat.\\n“You're a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you\\nought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive\\nat all.”\\n“T am careful.”\\n“No, you’re not.”\\n‘Well, other people are,”’ she said lightly.\\n“What’s that got to do with it?”\\n“They'll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It\\ntakes two to make an accident.”\\n\\n72 THE GREAT GATSBY\\n‘“‘Suppose you met somebody just as careless as\\nyourself.”\\n“T hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate care-\\nless people. That’s why I like you.”\\nHer gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead,\\nbut she had deliberately shifted our relations, and\\nfor a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-\\nthinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes\\non my desires, and I knew that first I had to get\\nmyself definitely out of that tangle back home.\\nI'd been writing letters once a week and signing\\nthem: ‘Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was\\nhow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint\\nmustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip.\\nNevertheless there was a vague understanding that\\nhad to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\\nEvery one suspects himself of at least one of the\\ncardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the\\nfew honest people that I have ever known.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\nOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the\\nvillages alongshore, the world and its mistress re-\\nturned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously\\non his lawn.\\n“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, mov-\\ning somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.\\n“‘One time he killed a man who had found out that\\nhe was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second\\ncousin to the devil.

A souvenir\\nof Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the\\nman on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”\\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men\\nin blazers loafing in an archway through which were\\nvisible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking\\na little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in\\nhis hand.\\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers\\nflaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw\\nhim opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their\\ncrimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken\\nheart.\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 81\\n“T’m going to make a big request of you to-day,”\\nhe said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction,\\n““so I thought you ought to know something about\\nme.

His correctness\\ngrew on him as we neared the city. We passed\\nPort Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-\\nbelted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled\\nslum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the\\nfaded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.

We slowed\\ndown. Taking a white card from his wallet, he\\nwaved it before the man’s eyes.\\n“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping\\nhis cap. ‘Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Ex-\\ncuse me!”\\n“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of\\nOxford?”\\n“‘T was able to do the commissioner a favor once,\\nand he sends me a Christmas card every year.”\\nOver the great bridge, with the sunlight through\\nthe girders making a constant flicker upon the mov-\\ning cars, with the city rising up across the river in\\nwhite heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish\\nout of non-olfactory money. The city seen from\\nthe Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for\\nthe first time, in its first wild promise of all the mys-\\ntery and the beauty in the world.\\nA dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with\\nblooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds,\\nand by more cheerful carriages for friends.

I laughed aloud as the yolks\\nof their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.\\n“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over\\nthis bridge,”’ I thought; “‘anything at all... .”\\nEven Gatsby could happen, without any particu-\\nlar wonder.\\nRoaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second\\nStreet cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away\\nthe brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked\\nhim out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to an-\\nother man.\\n“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfs-\\nhiem.”\\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and\\nregarded me with two fine growths of hair which\\nluxuriated in either nostril.

Emphasizes Gatsby's eclectic appeal.\n* **Mrs. Ulysses (\"The Lady from the Village\"):**  A mysterious figure hinting at gossip, local intrigue, and perhaps a connection to Gatsby's past or shrouded origins. Adds an air of veiled secrets within the ostensibly open party.\n* **The Breweries & Liquor Representatives:** (Names like \"Mr. Wolfsheim's associate\") - Underscores the Prohibition-era context.  Gatsby's wealth fuels illicit activities, highlighting the societal contradictions and underbelly of glamour.\n* **\"Young Men from Harvard and Yale\":**  Represents  privileged lineage and academic prestige, further solidifying Gatsby's attempts to integrate with established power structures. Their presence adds a layer of intellectual facade to the revelry.\n* **Unspecified \"Dances and Games\" Participants:** While nameless, their inclusion emphasizes the structured entertainment and performative aspects of these gatherings. It's not just random chaos, but orchestrated amusement catering to expectations.\n\n**5.  Thematic Reinforcement through Additions:**\n\n* **Blurred Lines:**  The expanded list shows how Gatsby's world intersects various spheres – legitimate arts, underworld figures, academic elitism, all converging in his opulent domain.\n* **Performance & Illusion:**  More names, with hints of ambiguity (like Mrs. Ulysses), reinforce the idea that appearances and curated identities are paramount in this society.\n* **Prohibition's Shadow:**  The liquor representatives directly link Gatsby's success to illicit activities, adding a darker undercurrent to the glittering facade.\n\n\n\nBy encompassing these additional entities, the analysis gains richness and depth, revealing a more intricate tapestry of the Roaring Twenties social fabric within Gatsby's extravagant realm.",

Here's a breakdown based on extracted information and thematic implications:\\r\\n\\r\\n**1. Categorization and Origins:**\\r\\n   * **East Egg & West Egg Residents:**  The primary division reflects social strata even within wealth. East Egg implies old money, established families (Cheadles, Dancies, Auerbachs, etc.), while West Egg hints at newer fortunes and ambition (Mulreadys, Film industry folks like Orchid). Gatsby himself bridges this divide with his lavish parties attracting both.\\r\\n   * **NYC Influx:**  A significant portion hail from New York City (Chromes, Backhyssons, etc.), showcasing Gatsby's reach across social circles and the convergence of glamour in the metropolis.\\r\\n   * **Thematic Groups:**  Unofficial categories emerge: \\\"theatrical people,\\\" those connected to movies/entertainment, gamblers/speculators (Ferret, Associated Traction), and even  individuals with peculiar histories (like Snell's accident or  Henry Palmetto's suicide).\\r\\n\\r\\n**2.  Personality & Remarkable Details:**\\r\\n   * **Eccentricities Emphasized:**  Descriptions like Edgar Beaver's sudden white hair, Klipspringer (\\\"the boarder\\\"), and Benny McClenahan's interchangeable girl companions add color and  a sense of the absurd prevalent in this era.\\r\\n   * **Names as Indicators:**  Melodic flower/capitalist names for the girls, \\\"Duke\\\" for the prince, underscore the performative nature of identity and social climbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n**3.  Social Dynamics & Gatsby's Influence:**\\r\\n   * **Networked Existence:**  Interconnections are abundant (cousins, shared acquaintances, professional links). Gatsby's parties become focal points, drawing in diverse individuals.\\r\\n   * **American Exceptionalism:** Gatsby's \\\"resourcefulness\\\" and the American style emphasized highlight a culture of mobility, self-made success, and a certain nonchalance towards traditional norms.\\r\\n   * **Power & Invitation:** Gatsby directly invites the narrator, showcasing his desire to control the narrative and weave himself into established social circles. His wealth acts as a magnet, but the *choice* to attend speaks volumes about status and perception.\\r\\n\\r\\n**In Conclusion:** This passage is more than a guest list; it's a snapshot of the Jazz Age's complexities:  opulence, fleeting connections, performative identities, and the allure (and perhaps illusion) of Gatsby's world. It sets the stage for exploring themes of class, ambition, and the elusive American Dream within the novel's narrative.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

This quality was continually breaking\\nthrough his punctilious manner in the shape of rest-\\nlessness. He was never quite still; there was always\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 77\\na tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening\\nand closing of a hand.\\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\\n“Tt’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off\\nto give me a better view. “‘Haven’t you ever seen\\nit before?”\\nI’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich\\ncream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and\\nthere in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-\\nboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and ter-\\nraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored\\na dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of\\nglass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we\\nstarted to town.\\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times\\nin the past month and found, to my disappointment,\\nthat he had little to say. So my first impression, that\\nhe was a person of some undefined consequence, had\\ngradually faded and he had become simply the pro-\\nprietor of an elaborate road-house next door.\\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We\\nhadn’t reached West Egg Village before Gatsby\\nbegan leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and\\nslapping himself indecisively on the knee of his\\ncaramel-colored suit.\\n“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly,\\n“‘what’s your opinion of me, anyhow?”\\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized eva-\\nsions which that question deserves.\\n\\n78 THE GREAT GATSBY\\n“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my\\nlife,” he interrupted. “I don’t want you to get a\\nwrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.”\\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that\\nflavored conversation in his halls.\\n“T’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand sud-\\ndenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. “TI\\nam the son of some wealthy people in the Middle\\nWest—all dead now. I was brought up in America\\nbut educated at Oxford, because all my ancestors\\nhave been educated there for many years. It is a\\nfamily tradition.”\\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jor-\\ndan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried\\nthe phrase ‘educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it,\\nor choked on it, as though it had bothered him be-\\nfore. And with this doubt, his whole statement fell\\nto pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something\\na little sinister about him, after all.\\n“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired\\ncasually.\\n“San Francisco.”\\n“T see.”\\n“My family all died and I came into a good deal\\nof money.”\\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that\\nsudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For\\na moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg,\\nbut a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 79\\n“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the\\ncapitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collect-\\ning jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, paint-\\ning a little, things for myself only, and trying to\\nforget something very sad that had happened to me\\nlong ago.”\\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredu-\\nlous laughter. The very phrases were worn so\\nthreadbare that they evoked no image except that\\nof a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every\\npore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de\\nBoulogne.\\n“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great\\nrelief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to\\nbear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission\\nas first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne\\nForest I took the remains of my machine-gun bat-\\ntalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap\\non either side of us where the infantry couldn’t\\nadvance.

Then, with re-\\nluctance:\\n“T want to get the grass cut,” he said.\\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a\\nsharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the\\ndarker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected\\nthat he meant my grass.\\n“There’s another little thing,” he said uncer-\\ntainly, and hesitated.\\n“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I\\nasked.\\n“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—”’’ He fumbled\\nwith a series of beginnings. ‘Why, I thought—why,\\nlook here, old sport, you don’t make much money,\\ndo you?”\\n“Not very much.”\\n\\n100 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued\\nmore confidently.\\n“T thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you\\nsee, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of\\nside line, you understand. And I thought that if\\nyou don’t make very much— You’re selling bonds,\\naren’t you, old sport?”\\ncc Trying to.”\\n“Well, this would interest you.

But, because the offer was obviously\\nand tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no\\nchoice except to cut him off there.\\n“Tve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much\\nobliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.”\\n“You wouldn’t have to do any business with\\nWolfshiem.” Evidently he thought that I was shy-\\ning away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at\\nlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited\\na moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation,\\nbut I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went\\nunwillingly home.\\nThe evening had made me light-headed and happy;\\nI think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my\\nfront door.

At eleven\\no’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower,\\ntapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby\\nhad sent him over to cut my grass.

The girl who was with him got into the\\npapers, too, because her arm was broken—she was\\none of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara\\nHotel.\\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they\\nwent to France for a year. I saw them one spring\\nin Cannes, and later in Deauville, and then they\\ncame back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was\\npopular in Chicago, as you know. They moved\\nwith a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and\\nwild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect\\nreputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s\\n\\n94 THE GREAT GATSBY\\na great advantage not to drink among hard-drink-\\ning people. You can hold your tongue, and, more-\\nover, you can time any little irregularity of your\\nown so that everybody else is so blind that they\\ndon’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for\\namour at all—and yet there’s something in that\\nvoice of hers... .\\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name\\nGatsby for the first time in years. It was when I\\nasked you—do you remember ?—if you knew Gatsby\\nin West Egg. After you had gone home she came\\ninto my room and woke me up, and said: ‘‘What\\nGatsby?” and when I described him—I was half\\nasleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must\\nbe the man she used to know. It wasn’t until then\\nthat I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her\\nwhite car.\\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this\\nwe had left the Plaza for half an hour and were\\ndriving in a victoria through Central Park. The\\nsun had gone down behind the tall apartments of\\nthe movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear\\nvoices of children, already gathered like crickets on\\nthe grass, rose through the hot twilight:\\n“T’m the Sheik of Araby.\\nYour love belongs to me.\\nAt night when you’re asleep\\nInto your tent I’ll creep——”\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 95\\n“Tt was a strange coincidence,” I said.\\n“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”\\n“Why not?”\\n“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would\\nbe just across the bay.”\\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which\\nhe had aspired on that June night. He came alive\\nto me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his\\npurposeless splendor.\\n“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “‘if you’ll\\ninvite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then\\nlet him come over.”\\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had\\nwaited five years and bought a mansion where he\\ndispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he\\ncould ‘‘come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s\\ngarden.\\n“Did I have to know all this before he could ask\\nsuch al ittle thing?”\\n“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought\\nyou might be offended. You see, he’s regular tough\\nunderneath it all.”\\nSomething worried me.\\n“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”\\n“He wants her to see his house,” she explained.\\n“‘And your house is right next door.”\\nce Oh !9\\n“T think he half expected her to wander into one\\nof his parties, some night,’’ went on Jordan, ‘‘but\\n\\n96 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nshe never did. Then he began asking people casually\\nif they knew her, and I was the first one he found.\\nIt was that night he sent for me at his dance, and\\nyou should have heard the elaborate way he worked\\nup to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a\\nluncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:\\n“**T don’t want to do anything out of the way!’\\nhe kept saying. ‘I want to see her right next door.’\\n“‘When I said you were a particular friend of\\nTom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea. He\\ndoesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says\\nhe’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the\\nchance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”\\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under al ittle\\nbridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoul-\\nder and drew her toward me and asked her to din-\\nner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and\\nGatsby any more, but of this clean, hard, limited\\nperson, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who\\nleaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort\\nof heady excitement: “‘There are only the pursued,\\nthe pursuing, the busy and the tired.”\\n‘And Daisy ought to have something in her life,”’\\nmurmured Jordan to me.\\n“Does she want to see Gatsby?”\\n“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t\\nwant her to know. You’re just supposed to invite\\nher to tea.”\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 97\\nWe passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the\\nfacade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale\\nlight, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby\\nand Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied\\nface floated along the dark cornices and blinding\\nsigns, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tighten-\\ning my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled, and\\nso I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.\\n\\nCHAPTER\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entities\\\", [\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Gatsby\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"PERSON\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Daisy\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"PERSON\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Jordan Baker\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"PERSON\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Tom Buchanan\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"PERSON\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Central Park\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"LOCATION\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Plaza\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"LOCATION\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"West Egg\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"LOCATION\\\", \\\"note\\\": \\\"Contextually implied location\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Chicago\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"LOCATION\\\"},\\r\\n  {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Fifty-ninth Street\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"LOCATION\\\"}\\r\\n])\\r\\n\\r\\n**Relationships & Narrative Threads (Deduced):**\\r\\n* **Gatsby's Obsession:** Gatsby deeply desires to reconnect with Daisy, going to great lengths (buying a mansion across the bay) to orchestrate a possibility. He avoids overt actions, preferring subtle arrangements through others like Nick and Jordan.\\r\\n* **Daisy's Situation:** Daisy is caught in Gatsby's longing gaze but remains unaware of his orchestrated plan. Her current life and feelings are unclear, hinted at with Jordan's comment about her needing \\\"something\\\" in her life.\\r\\n* **Nick as Mediator:** Nick serves as a crucial link between Gatsby and Daisy, unwittingly drawn into Gatsby's scheme. His narration provides insights into both Gatsby's meticulous planning and Daisy's ambiguous position.\\r\\n* **Jordan's Role:** Jordan acts as Gatsby's confidante and facilitator, relaying information and suggesting strategies while displaying a pragmatic, somewhat cynical worldview.\\r\\n* **Social Circles & Past Connections:**  The narrative highlights connections within affluent circles (Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, Jordan) and alludes to past relationships and events in Chicago, adding layers of complexity. \\r\\n* **Thematic Tension:**  A central theme emerging is the contrast between Gatsby's idealized pursuit and reality's complexities. His grand gestures clash with Daisy's potential indifference, creating suspense about their reunion's outcome. \\n\\n\\n**Continuing Analysis Points (For Deeper Dive):**\\r\\n* **Daisy's Agency:**  As the narrative progresses,  analyzing how much *choice* Daisy truly has within Gatsby's plan and societal expectations will be crucial.\\r\\n* **Symbolism & Setting:** Pay close attention to symbols like Gatsby's mansion, parties, and the changing park landscapes – they amplify thematic ideas about longing, illusion, and the American Dream.\\r\\n* **Jordan's Character Development:**  Exploring her cynicism further and how it interacts with Gatsby's romanticism will reveal deeper character dynamics.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

By the next year\\nI had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in\\ntournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often. She\\nwent with a slightly older crowd—when she went\\nwith anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating\\nabout her—how her mother had found her packing\\nher bag one winter night to go to New York and\\nsay good-by to a soldier who was going overseas.\\nShe was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on\\nspeaking terms with her family for several weeks.\\nAfter that she didn’t play around with the soldiers\\nany more, but only with a few flat-footed, short-\\nsighted young men in town, who couldn’t get into\\nthe army at all.\\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as\\never. She had a début after the armistice, and in\\nFebruary she was presumably engaged to a man\\nfrom New Orleans. In June she married Tom\\nBuchanan of Chicago, with more pomp and cir-\\ncumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He\\ncame down with a hundred people in four private\\ncars, and hired a whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel,\\nand the day before the wedding he gave her a string\\n\\n92 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nof pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand\\ndollars.\\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half\\nan hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying\\non her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered\\ndress—and as drunk as a monkey.

Tell ’em\\nall Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’\\nher mine!’”\\nShe began to cry—sne cried and cried. I rushed\\nout and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the\\ndoor and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t\\nlet go of the letter. She took it into the tub with\\nher and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only\\nlet me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that\\nit was coming to pieces like snow.\\nBut she didn’t say another word.

A week after\\nI left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the\\nVentura road one night, and ripped a front wheel\\noff his car. The girl who was with him got into the\\npapers, too, because her arm was broken—she was\\none of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara\\nHotel.\\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they\\nwent to France for a year.

He embodies  wealth and privilege intertwined with infidelity, creating tension.\r\n    * **Dynamic:** A foil to Gatsby, highlighting the contrasting values and lifestyles at play.\r\n* **Jordan Baker:** Daisy's friend, a golfer known for her cynicism and nonchalance.

His eyes\\nglanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with\\nan abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock\\ntook this moment to tilt dangerously at the pres-\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 105\\nsure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught\\nit with trembling fingers, and set it back in place.\\nThen he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of\\nthe sofa and his chin in his hand.\\n“T’m sorry about the clock,” he said.\\nMy own face had now assumed a deep tropical\\nburn. I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace\\nout of the thousand in my head.\\n“Tt’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.\\nI think we all believed for a moment that it had\\nsmashed in pieces on the floor.\\n“We haven’t met for many years,” , said Daisy,\\nher voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.\\n“Five years next November.”\\nThe automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us\\nall back at least another minute. I had them both\\non their feet with the desperate suggestion that they\\nhelp me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac\\nFinn brought it in on a tray.\\nAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a\\ncertain physical decency established itself. Gatsby\\ngot himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I\\ntalked, looked conscientiously from one to the other\\nof us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calm-\\nness wasn’t an end in itself, I made an excuse at the\\nfirst possible moment, and got to my feet.\\n‘““Where are you going?”? demanded Gatsby in\\nimmediate alarm.\\n“Tl be back.”\\n\\n106 THE GREAT GATSBY\\n“T’ve got to speak to you about something be-\\nfore you go.”\\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed\\nthe door, and whispered: ““Oh, God!” in a miser-\\nable way.\\n“What’s the matter?”\\n“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his\\nhead from side to side, “‘a terrible, terrible mistake.”\\n““You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily\\nI added: ‘‘Daisy’s embarrassed too.”\\n“‘She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.\\n“Just as much as you are.”\\n“Don’t talk so loud.”\\n“You’re acting like a little boy,”’ I broke out im-\\npatiently. “Not only that, but you’re rude.

Once more it was pouring, and\\nmy irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gar-\\ndener, abounded in small muddy swamps and pre-\\nhistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at\\nfrom under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house,\\nso I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 107\\nhalf an hour. A brewer had built it early in the\\n“period” craze, a decade before, and there was a\\nstory that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all\\nthe neighboring cottages if the owners would have\\ntheir roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their re-\\nfusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a\\nFamily—he went into an immediate decline. His\\nchildren sold his house with the black wreath still\\non the door.

A maid began open-\\ning the upper windows of his house, appeared mo-\\nmentarily in each, and, leaning from the large cen-\\ntral bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was\\ntime I went back. While the rain continued it had\\nseemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and\\nswelling a little now and then with gusts of emo-\\ntion.

But there was a\\nchange in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He\\nliterally glowed; without a word or a gesture of ex-\\nultation a new well-being radiated from him and\\nfilled the little room.\\n“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t\\nseen me for years. I thought for a moment he was\\ngoing to shake hands.\\n“Tt’s stopped raining.”\\n““Has it?’? When he realized what I was talking\\nabout, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in\\nthe room, he smiled like a weather man, like an\\necstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the\\nnews to Daisy. “‘What do you think of that? It’s\\nstopped raining.”\\n“T’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, griev-\\ning beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.\\n“T want you and Daisy to come over to my\\nhouse,”’ he said, ‘‘I’d like to show her around.”\\n““You’re sure you want me to come?”\\n“Absolutely, old sport.”\\nDaisy went up-stairs to wash her face—too late\\nI thought with humiliation of my towels—while\\nGatsby and I waited on the lawn.\\n“My house looks well, doesn’t it?”’ he demanded.\\n“See how the whole front of it catches the light.”\\nI agreed that it was splendid.\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY IoQ\\n“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door\\nand square tower. “It took me just three years to\\nearn the money that bought it.”\\n“T thought you inherited your money.”\\n“T did, old sport,” he said automatically, ‘but\\nI lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the\\nwar.”\\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for\\nwhen I asked him what business he was in he an-\\nswered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized that\\nit wasn’t an appropriate reply.\\n“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected\\nhimself. ‘‘I was in the drug business and then I was\\nin the oil business. But I’m not in either one now.”\\nHe looked at me with more attention. ‘““Do you\\nmean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed\\nthe other night?”\\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the\\nhouse and two rows of brass buttons on her dress\\ngleamed in the sunlight.\\n“That huge place there?’ she cried pointing.\\n“Do you like it?”\\n“T love it, but I don’t see how you live there all\\nalone.”\\n“T keep it always full of interesting people, night\\nand day. People who do interesting things. Cele-\\nbrated people.”\\nInstead of taking the short cut along the Sound\\nwe went down to the road and entered by the big\\n\\n110 THE GREAT GATSBY\\npostern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired\\nthis aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against\\nthe sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of\\njonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum\\nblossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-\\ngate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and\\nfind no stir of bright dresses in and out the door,\\nand hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.\\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie An-\\ntoinette music-rooms and Restoration Salons, I felt\\nthat there were guests concealed behind every\\ncouch and table, under orders to be breathlessly\\nsilent until we had passed through. As Gatsby\\nclosed the door of “the Merton College Library” I\\ncould have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break\\ninto ghostly laughter.\\nWe went up-stairs, through period bedrooms\\nswathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with\\nnew flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,\\nand bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into\\none chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas\\nwas doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr.\\nKlipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wan-\\ndering hungrily about the beach that morning.\\nFinally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bed-\\nroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we\\nsat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he\\ntook from a cupboard in the wall.\\nHe hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY III\\nthink he revalued everything in his house according\\nto the measure of response it drew from her well-\\nloved eyes.

It was James Gatz who had been loafing\\nalong the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey\\nand a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay\\nGatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the\\nTuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might\\ncatch him and break him up in half an hour.\\nI suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time,\\neven then. His parents were shiftless and unsuc-\\ncessful farm people—his imagination had never really\\naccepted them as his parents at all.

He transcends his humble origins, becoming a \\\"son of God\\\" in his own mind, driven by ambition and a romanticized ideal.\\r\\n   * **Shift from James to Jay:** This renaming at age 17 marks a pivotal point where Gatsby embraces his idealized self, distancing himself from his past and parents.

Themes Emerging:**\\r\\n   * **Self-invention and Illusion:** Gatsby's narrative is central to exploring how individuals shape identities and construct realities to fulfill desires.\\r\\n   * **The Allure of Myth:**  Society's fascination with creating and accepting narratives, even fantastical ones, adds another layer to Gatsby's story.\\r\\n   * **Ambition and Escapism:** Gatsby's pursuit transcends material wealth; it's a quest for a mythical self and a life divorced from his origins.\\n\\n\\n**Relationships (Connecting Entities):**\\r\\n* **Gatsby (James Gatz) <-> Transformation:**  His name change signifies a complete metamorphosis driven by ambition and self-creation.\\r\\n* **Gatsby <-> Reputation/Myths:** His lavish lifestyle and enigmatic nature breed rumors and legends, shaping his public image.\\r\\n* **Cody <-> Gatsby's Inspiration:** Cody serves as a catalyst and model, influencing Gatsby's trajectory.\\r\\n* **Platonic Ideal <-> Gatsby's Identity:**  His constructed self stems from an idealized vision, not purely factual origins.\\r\\n* **Society <-> Mythmaking:**  People readily embrace and perpetuate Gatsby's myths, highlighting societal tendencies.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

His parents were shiftless and unsuc-\\ncessful farm people—his imagination had never really\\naccepted them as his parents at all. The truth was\\nthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang\\nfrom his Platonic conception of himself. He was a\\nson of God—a phrase which, if it means anything,\\nmeans just that—and he must be about His Fa-\\nther’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and\\nmeretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort\\nof Jay Gatsby that a seventeen year-old boy would\\nbe likely to invent, and to this conception he was\\nfaithful to the end.\\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along\\nthe south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger\\nand a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that\\nbrought him food and bed. His brown, hardening\\nbody lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 119g\\nlazy work of the bracing days. He knew women\\nearly, and since they spoiled him he became contemp-\\ntuous of them, of young virgins because they were\\nignorant, of the others because they were hysterical\\nabout things which in his overwhelming self-absorb-\\ntion he took for granted.\\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.\\nThe most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted\\nhim in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudi-\\nness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked\\non the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet\\nlight his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night\\nhe added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsi-\\nness closed down upon some vivid scene with an\\noblivious embrace. For a while these reveries pro-\\nvided an outlet for his imagination; they were a\\nsatisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise\\nthat the rock of the world was founded securely on\\na fairy’s wing.\\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him,\\nsome months before, to the small Lutheran College\\nof St. Olaf’s in northern Minnesota. He stayed there\\ntwo weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to\\nthe drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and de-\\nspising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay\\nhis way through. Then he drifted back to Lake\\nSuperior, and he was still searching for something to\\ndo on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor\\nin the shallows alongshore.\\n\\n120 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the\\nNevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for\\nmetal since seventy-five. The transactions in Mon-\\ntana copper that made him many times a millionaire\\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-\\nmindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number\\nof women tried to separate him from his money.\\nThe none too savory ramifications by which Ella\\nKaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de\\nMaintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in\\na yacht, were common property of the turgid jour-\\nnalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too\\nhospitable shores for five years when he turned up\\nas James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.\\nTo young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking\\nup at the railed deck, that yacht represented all\\nthe beauty and glamour in the world. 1 suppose he\\nsmiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that\\npeople liked him when he smiled. At any rate\\nCody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited\\nthe brand new name) and found that he was quick\\nand extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he\\ntook him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six\\npair of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.\\nAnd when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and\\nthe Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.\\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity—\\nwhile he remained with Cody he was in turn steward,\\nmate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 121\\nCody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody\\ndrunk might soon be about, and he provided for such\\ncontingencies by reposing more and more trust in\\nGatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during\\nwhich the boat went three times around the Con-\\ntinent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for\\nthe fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in\\nBoston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably\\ndied.\\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s\\nbedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face\\n—the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of\\nAmerican life brought back to the Eastern seaboard\\nthe savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.\\nIt was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so\\nlittle. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women\\nused to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he\\nformed the habit of letting liquor alone.\\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money—\\na legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t\\nget it. He never understood the legal device that\\nwas used against him, but what remained of the\\nmillions went intact to Ella Kaye.

Perhaps some unbelievable guest would\\narrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled\\nat, some authentically radiant young girl who with\\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical\\nencounter, would blot out those five years of un-\\nwavering devotion.\\nI stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait\\nuntil he was free, and I lingered in the garden until\\nthe inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled\\nand exalted, from the black beach, until the lights\\nwere extinguished in the guest-rooms overhead.\\nWhen he came down the steps at last the tanned skin\\nwas drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes\\nwere bright and tired.\\n“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\\n“Of course she did.”\\n“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “‘She didn’t have\\na good time.”\\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable\\ndepression.\\n“T feel far away from her,” he said. ‘It’s hard to\\nmake her understand.”\\n“You mean about the dance?”\\n“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had\\ngiven with a snap of his fingers. ‘‘Old sport, the dance\\nis unimportant.”\\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she\\nshould go to Tom and say: “I never loved you.”\\nAfter she had obliterated four years with that sen-\\ntence they could decide upon the more practical\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 133\\nmeasures to be taken. One of them was that, after\\nshe was free, they were to go back to Louisville and\\nbe married from her house—just as if it were five\\nyears ago.\\n“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. ‘‘She used\\nto be able to understand. We'd sit for hours——”’\\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a\\ndesolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and\\ncrushed flowers.\\n“T wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured.\\n“You can’t repeat the past.”\\n“‘Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously.\\n“Why of course you can!”\\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were\\nlurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of\\nreach of his hand.\\n“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was\\nbefore,” he said, nodding determinedly. ‘‘She’ll see.”\\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that\\nhe wanted to recover something, some idea of him-\\nself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His\\nlife had been confused and disordered since then,\\nbut if he could once return to a certain starting\\nplace and go over it all slowly, he could find out\\nwhat that thing was... .\\n. . . One autumn night, five years before, they\\nhad been walking down the street when the leaves\\nwere falling, and they came to a place where there\\nwere no trees and the sidewalk was white with moon-\\nlight. They stopped here and turned toward each\\n\\n134 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nother. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious\\nexcitement in it which comes at the two changes of\\nthe year. The quiet lights in the houses were hum-\\nming out into the darkness and there was a stir and\\nbustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye\\nGatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really\\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above\\nthe trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone,\\nand once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp\\ndown the incomparable milk of wonder.\\nHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white\\nface came up to his own. He knew that when he\\nkissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable vi-\\nsions to her perishable breath, his mind would never\\nromp again like the mind of God. So he waited,\\nlistening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork\\nthat had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed\\nher. At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like\\na flower and the incarnation was complete.\\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling\\nsentimentality, I was reminded of something—an\\nelusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had\\nheard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a\\nphrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips\\nparted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more\\nstruggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.\\nBut they made no sound, and what I had almost\\nremembered was uncommunicable forever.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\nIr was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its\\nhighest that the lights in his house failed to go on one\\nSaturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun,\\nhis career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually\\ndid I become aware that the automobiles which\\nturned expectantly into his drive stayed for just\\na minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering\\nif he were sick I went over to find out—an unfa-\\nmiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me\\nsuspiciously from the door.\\n“Ts Mr. Gatsby sick?”\\n‘“‘Nope.” After a pause he added “‘sir’’ in a dila-\\ntory, grudging way.\\n*“‘T hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather wor-\\nried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.”\\n“Who?” he demanded rudely.\\n“Carraway.”\\n“Carraway.

This adds a layer of moral complexity.\r\n    * **\"Girl\" on Tom's Phone (unnamed):**  Explicitly referenced by Jordan, she represents the extramarital entanglement fueling Tom's anger and adding to the tangled relationship dynamics. Her anonymity intensifies the secrecy and gossip surrounding her.\r\n    * **The Host/Hostess (unnamed):**  While not directly involved in the core conflict, their salon setting implies social standing and influence. They provide the stage for these unfolding dramas.\r\n\r\n* **Strengthened Connections & Implications:\r\n    * Gatsby - Wolfsheim:**  Their past association suggests a network Gatsby navigates, raising questions about the legitimacy of his wealth and dealings.\r\n    * Social Hierarchy: The emphasis on unnamed guests, a specific \"salon,\" and Tom's phone call hinting at affairs underscores the rigid social strata and unspoken rules governing behavior in this world. Nick, as an outsider, observes this dynamic with growing awareness.\r\n    * Atmosphere of Surveillance:  Even without direct confrontation, the constant observation (guests, Jordan's whispers) creates a sense of everyone being judged and secrets constantly in flux.\n\n\nBy incorporating these additional entities and their connections, we gain a more multifaceted view of the social and emotional landscape within Gatsby's world.",

As we passed over the dark\\nbridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s\\nshoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died\\naway with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling\\ntwilight.\\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee\\njoint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness\\nat the inquest. He had slept through the heat until\\n\\n164 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nafter five, when he strolled over to the garage, and\\nfound George Wilson sick in his office—really sick,\\npale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Mich-\\naelis advised him to go to bed, but Wilson refused,\\nsaying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While\\nhis neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent\\nracket broke out overhead.\\n“T’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained\\nWilson calmly. ‘“‘She’s going to stay there till the\\nday after to-morrow, and then we’re going to move\\naway.”\\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neigh-\\nbors for four years, and Wilson had never seemed\\nfaintly capable of such a statement. Generally he\\nwas one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t\\nworking, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared\\nat the people and the cars that passed along the\\nroad. When any one spoke to him he invariably\\nlaughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his\\nwife’s man and not his own.\\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had\\nhappened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead\\nhe began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his\\nvisitor and ask him what he’d been doing at cer-\\ntain times on certain days. Just as the latter was\\ngetting uneasy, some workmen came past the door\\nbound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the op-\\nportunity to get away, intending to come back later.\\nBut he didn’t.

The other car, the one\\ngoing toward New York, came to rest a hundred\\nyards beyond, and it’s driver hurried back to where\\nMyrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt\\nin the road and mingled her thick dark blood with\\nthe dust.\\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but\\nwhen they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp\\nwith perspiration, they saw that her left breast was\\nswinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to\\nlisten for the heart beneath.

Then I walked slowly down the\\n\\n172 THE GREAT GATSBY\\ndrive away from the house, intending to wait by the\\ngate.\\nI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my\\nname and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes\\ninto the path. I must have felt pretty weird by\\nthat time, because I could think of nothing except\\nthe luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\\n“What are you doing?” I inquired.\\n“Just standing here, old sport.”\\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.\\nFor all I knew he was going to rob the house in a\\nmoment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinis-\\nter faces, the faces of “‘Wolfshiem’s people,” behind\\nhim in the dark shrubbery.\\n“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked\\nafter a minute.\\ncc Yes.”’\\nHe hesitated.\\n“Was she killed?”\\nccYc es.”\\n“T thought so; I told Daisy I thought so.

She\\nstood it pretty well.”\\nHe spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing\\nthat mattered.\\n“T got to West Egg bya side road,” he went on,\\n“‘and left the car in my garage.

Her husband owns the\\ngarage. How the devil did it happen?”\\n“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—”’ He broke\\noff, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\\n“Was Daisy driving?”\\n“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course\\nI'll say I was. You see, when we left New York she\\nwas very nervous and she thought it would steady\\nher to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just\\nas we were passing a car coming the other way. It\\nall happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that\\nshe wanted to speak to us, thought we were some-\\nbody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from\\nthe woman toward the other car, and then she lost\\nher nerve and turned back. The second my hand\\nreached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have\\nkilled her instantly.”\\n“Tt ripped her open——”\\n“Don’t tell me, old sport.”’ He winced. “Any-\\nhow—Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop,\\nbut she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake.\\nThen she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\\n“She’ll be all right to-morrow,” he said presently.\\n“T’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to\\nbother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.\\nShe’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any\\nbrutality she’s going to turn the light out and on\\nagain.”\\n\\n174 THE GREAT GATSBY\\n“He won’t touch her,” I said.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"**Characters:**\\\" ,  [\\\"Tom\\\", \\\"Daisy\\\", \\\"Gatsby\\\", \\\"Jordan\\\", \\\"Wilson\\\", \\\"Butler\\\"]) \\r\\n(\\\"**Relationships/Interactions Emphasized:**\\\" , [\\\"Tension between Gatsby and narrator (Nick), Gatsby's protective stance towards Daisy, Daisy's emotional state and Gatsby's handling of it, Uncertainty and suspicion surrounding the accident\\\"])\\r\\n(\\\"**Key Events & Themes Extracted:**\\\" , [\\r\\n    \\\"**Fatal Accident:** A hit-and-run involving Daisy driving Gatsby's car, resulting in the death of Mrs. Wilson (implied).

As a matter of fact, he had\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 179\\nno such facilities—he had no comfortable family\\nstanding behind him, and he was liable at the whim\\nof an impersonal government to be blown anywhere\\nabout the world.\\nBut he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out\\nas he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to\\ntake what he could and go—but now he found that\\nhe had committed himself to the following of a\\ngrail.

Her porch was bright with the bought\\nluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked\\nfashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed\\nher curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a\\ncold, and it made her voice huskier and more charm-\\ning than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly\\naware of the youth and mystery that wealth im-\\nprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many\\nclothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and\\nproud above the hot struggles of the poor.\\n“T can’t describe to you how surprised I was to\\nfind out I loved her, old sport.

Ambitious but ultimately driven by love and longing for the past.\\r\\n* **Daisy:**  Attractive, wealthy, embodies the allure and privilege Gatsby desires. Initially portrayed as carefree and somewhat unaware of Gatsby's true situation, but develops genuine feelings for him.\\r\\n* **Narrator (Nick Carraway):** Observer and storyteller, provides insights into Gatsby's character and his relationship with Daisy.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Relationships & Key Events (Deduced from the Passage):**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Love & Obsession (Gatsby - Daisy):**  The central theme. Gatsby is infatuated with Daisy,  viewing her as extraordinary and \\\"extraordinary a 'nice' girl\\\" could be. He strives to create an image worthy of her love, even resorting to deception initially.\\r\\n2. **Illusion vs. Reality:** Gatsby constructs a facade of wealth and success to impress Daisy, hiding his penniless beginnings and uncertain future. This creates a tension between his manufactured persona and genuine feelings.\\r\\n3. **Shared Moments & Connection:**  Despite the disparity in their backgrounds, intimate moments like sitting by the fire, gentle touches, and whispered conversations forge a profound connection between them. Gatsby finds solace and fulfillment in these shared experiences.\\r\\n4. **Parting & Uncertainty:** Daisy's letters reveal worry and Gatsby's impending departure abroad adds a layer of anxiety and uncertainty to their burgeoning love. The passage ends hinting at a potential rift due to circumstances beyond their control.\\r\\n5. **Gatsby's Military Success & Displacement:** While Gatsby excels in the war, bureaucratic complications send him to Oxford instead of home to Daisy, further straining their connection.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Implicit Themes Emerging:**\\r\\n* **The American Dream & its Discontents:** Gatsby's pursuit of wealth symbolizes chasing an idealized version of success, but true happiness seems tied to genuine connection, not material possessions.\\r\\n* **Love & Class Divide:**  Their romance explores how societal barriers and differing backgrounds influence love and its complexities.\\r\\n* **Nostalgia & the Past's Grip:** Gatsby's yearning for Daisy is rooted in a romanticized past, highlighting the human tendency to seek solace in idealized memories. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Note:** Further analysis of the complete novel would enrich these understandings and reveal deeper thematic layers.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

The fading sunlight mirrors his dwindling hope, creating a poignant sense of loss and urgency.\r\n* **The Weight of Societal Expectations:** Gatsby's efforts to impress and belong within the elite circle adds a dimension of societal pressure influencing his actions and Daisy's perception of him.\n\n\nThe narrative becomes richer with these additional entities and their interwoven connections.",

Finally some one said it was a\\nshame, and closed the door. Michaelis and several\\nother men were with him; first, four or five men,\\nlater two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to\\nask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes\\nlonger, while he went back to his own place and\\nmade a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there\\nalone with Wilson until dawn.\\nAbout three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s inco-\\nherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and\\nbegan to talk about the yellow car. He announced\\nthat he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car\\nbelonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of\\nmonths ago his wife had come from the city with her\\nface bruised and her nose swollen.\\nBut when he heard himself say this, he flinched\\nand began to cry “‘Oh, my God!” again in his groan-\\ning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to dis-\\ntract him.\\n“How long have you been married, George?\\nCome on there, try and sit still a minute and answer\\nmy question.

Maybe even if you haven’t been there for\\na long time? Maybe I could call up the church and\\nget a priest to come over and he could talk to you,\\nsee?”\\n“Don’t belong to any.”\\n“You ought to have a church, George, for times\\nlike this. You must have gone to church once.\\nDidn’t you get married inachurch? Listen, George,\\nlisten to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”\\n“That was a long time ago.”\\nThe effort of answering broke the rhythm of his\\nrocking—for a moment he was silent. Then the\\nsame half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back\\ninto his faded eyes.\\n“‘Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at\\nthe desk.\\n“Which drawer?”\\n“That drawer—that one.”\\nMichaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.\\nThere was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-\\n\\n190 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nleash, made of leather and braided silver.

First he nodded\\npolitely, and then his face broke into that radiant\\nand understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic\\ncahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink\\nrag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the\\nwhite steps, and I thought of the night when I first\\ncame to his ancestral home, three months before.\\nThe lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces\\nof those who guessed at his corruption—and he had\\nstood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible\\ndream, as he waved them good-by.\\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were al-\\nways thanking him for that—I and the others.\\n““Good-by,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast,\\nGatsby.”\\nUp in the city, I tried for a while to list the quo-\\ntations on an interminable amount of stock, then\\nI fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon\\nthe phone woke me, and I started up with sweat\\nbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker;\\nshe often called me up at this hour because the un-\\ncertainty of her own movements between hotels\\nand clubs and private houses made her hard to find.\\n\\n186 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nin any other way. Usually her voice came over the\\nwire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from\\na green golf-links had come sailing in at the office\\nwindow, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.\\n“T’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at\\nHempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton\\nthis afternoon.”\\nProbably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house,\\nbut the act annoyed me, and her next remark made\\nme rigid.\\n“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”\\n“How could it have mattered then?”\\nSilence for a moment. Then:\\n““However—I want to see you.”\\n“T want to see you, too.”\\n“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come\\ninto town this afternoon?”\\n“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”\\n“Very well.”\\n“Tt’s impossible this afternoon. Various——’ >\\nWe talked like that for a while, and then abruptly\\nwe weren’t talking any longer. I don’t know which\\nof us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn’t\\ncare. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-\\ntable that day if I never talked to her again in this\\nworld.\\nTI called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but\\nthe line was busy. I tried four times; finally an ex-\\nasperated central told me the wire was being kept\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 187\\nopen for long distance from Detroit. Taking out\\nmy time-table, I drew a small circle around the\\nthree-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair\\nand tried to think. It was just noon.\\nWhen I passed the ashheaps on the train that\\nmorning I had crossed deliberately to the other side\\nof the car. I supposed there’d be a curious crowd\\naround there all day with little boys searching for\\ndark spots in the dust, and some garrulous man tell-\\ning over and over what had happened, until it be-\\ncame less and less real even to him and he could\\ntell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achieve-\\nment was forgotten. Now I want to go back a\\nlittle and tell what happened at the garage after\\nwe left there the night before.\\nThey had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.\\nShe must have broken her rule against drinking that\\nnight, for when she arrived she was stupid with\\nliquor and unable to understand that the ambulance\\nhad already gone to Flushing. When they convinced\\nher of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was\\nthe intolerable part of the affair. Some one, kind or\\ncurious, took her in his car and drove her in the\\nwake of her sister’s body.\\nUntil long after midnight a changing crowd lapped\\nup against the front of the garage,\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"## Entities and Relationships from Gatsby Excerpt:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Characters:**\\r\\n* **Narrator (Nick Carraway):** Central perspective, reflects on Gatsby and events.\\r\\n* **Jay Gatsby:**  Subject of admiration and disapproval, hosting lavish parties, concealing a dream.\\r\\n* **Jordan Baker:** Golfer, enigmatic, contacts Nick, hints at tension with Daisy.\\r\\n* **Daisy Buchanan:**  Married woman, object of Gatsby's affection, implied involvement in Myrtle's death.\\r\\n* **Catherine (Myrtle's Sister):** Drunk and distraught after Myrtle's fatal accident.\\r\\n* **Myrtle Wilson:** Deceased, tragically killed in a hit-and-run, wife of George Wilson.\\r\\n* **George Wilson:** Owns the garage where Myrtle worked, grieving husband consumed by seeking the culprit.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Locations:** \\r\\n* **Gatsby's Mansion (West Egg):**  Scene of Nick's farewell to Gatsby, symbol of Gatsby's wealth and aspirations.\\r\\n* **Hempstead:** Where Jordan Baker is temporarily staying.\\r\\n* **Southampton:** Gatsby-associated locale, Jordan plans to visit.\\r\\n* **City (presumably New York):** Nick's workspace and where he converses with Jordan.\\r\\n* **Myrtle's Garage (Valley of Ashes):** Site of Myrtle's death and gathering crowds seeking information.\\r\\n* **Flushing:** Where Myrtle's body is transported.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Events & Themes:**\\r\\n* **Gatsby's Disillusionment (implied):** Nick's parting words reveal a sense Gatsby's idealized world clashes with reality.\\r\\n* **Aftermath of Tragedy:** Focus shifts to the repercussions of Myrtle's death, highlighting grief and investigation.\\r\\n* **Social Dynamics & Class:** Contrast between Gatsby's extravagant lifestyle and the somber garage scene emphasizes societal divisions. \\r\\n* **Communication & Distance:**  Nick and Jordan's phone conversation reveals strained feelings and unspoken truths.\\r\\n* **Searching for Truth:**  The crowds at the garage symbolize society's insatiable appetite for details and understanding in tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Relationships (Direct & Indirect):**\\r\\n* **Nick & Gatsby:** Admiration tinged with disapproval, a complex bond.\\r\\n* **Nick & Jordan:**  Shifting dynamic, hinting at past intimacy and current tension.\\r\\n* **Gatsby & Daisy (unseen but central):** Unresolved love, driving force behind Gatsby's actions and tragedy's root.\\r\\n* **Myrtle & George:** Tragically fractured marriage, Myrtle's pursuit of another life leading to devastating consequences.\\r\\n* **Society & Tragedy:**  The crowds at the garage represent a collective fascination with and dissection of misfortune. \\n\\n\\n**Note:** This analysis focuses on  *explicit* and *strongly implied*  relationships and themes within the provided excerpt.

But there\\nwas nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token\\nof forgotten violence, staring down from the wall.\\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 199\\na letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information\\nand urged him to come out on the next train.

It said only that the sender was leaving im-\\nmediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.\\nIt was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very\\nhelpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap\\nulster against the warm September day.

A new world, ma-\\nterial without being real, where poor ghosts, breath-\\ning dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about .. .\\nlike that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him\\nthrough the amorphous trees.\\nThe chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s proté-\\ngés—heard the shots—afterward he could only say\\nthat he hadn’t thought anything much about them.\\nI drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house\\nand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was\\nthe first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew\\nthen, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said,\\nfour of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I,\\nhurried down to the pool.\\nThere was a faint, barely perceptible movement\\nof the water as the fresh flow from one end urged\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 195\\nits way toward the drain at the other. With little\\nripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the\\nladen mattress moved irregularly down the pool.\\nA small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the\\nsurface was enough to disturb its accidental course\\nwith its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster\\nof leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of\\ntransit, a thin red circle in the water.\\nIt was after we started with Gatsby toward the\\nhouse that the gardener saw Wilson’s body al ittle\\nway off in the grass, and the holocaust was com-\\nplete.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\nAFTER two years I remember the rest of that day,\\nand that night and the next day, only as an endless\\ndrill of police and photographers and newspaper\\nmen in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope\\nstretched across the main gate and a policeman by\\nit kept out the curious, but little boys soon discov-\\nered that they could enter through my yard, and\\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-\\nmouthed about the pool. Some one with a positive\\nmanner, perhaps a detective, used the expression\\n“madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that\\nafternoon, and the adventitious authority of his\\nvoice set the key for the newspaper reports next\\nmorning.\\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—gro-\\ntesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When\\nMichaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light\\nWilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole\\ntale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade\\n—but Catherine, who might have said anything,\\ndidn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\\nof character about it too—looked at the coroner with\\ndetermined eyes under that corrected brow of hers,\\nand swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby,\\nthat her sister was completely happy with her hus-\\n196\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 197\\nband, that her sister had been into no mischief\\nwhatever. She convinced herself of it, and cried into\\nher handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more\\nthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\\nman ‘deranged by grief” in order that the case\\nmight remain in its simplest form. And it rested\\nthere.\\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessen-\\ntial. I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone.\\nFrom the moment I telephoned news of the catas-\\ntrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about\\nhim, and every practical question, was referred to\\nme. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as\\nhe lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or\\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was\\nresponsible, because no one else was interested—\\ninterested, I mean, with that intense personal in-\\nterest to which every one has some vague right at\\nthe end.\\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him,\\ncalled her instinctively and without hesitation. But\\nshe and Tom had gone away early that afternoon,\\nand taken baggage with them.\\n“Left no address?”\\n“cNs o.”\\n““Say when they’d be back?”\\n“No.”\\n“Any idea where they are? How I could reach\\nthem?”\\n\\n198 THE GREAT GATSBY\\n“T don’t know. Can’t say.”\\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to\\ngo into the room where he lay and reassure him:\\n“T’'ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry.\\nJust trust me and I’ll get somebody for you ye\\nMeyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone\\nbook. The butler gave me his office address on\\nBroadway, and I called Information, but by the\\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and\\nno one answered the phone.\\n“Will you ring again?”\\n“T’ve rung them three times.”\\n“It’s very important.”\\n“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”\\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for\\nan instant that they were chance visitors, all these\\nofficial people who suddenly filled it. But, though\\nthey drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\\n“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get some-\\nbody for me. You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go\\nthrough this alone.”\\nSome one started to ask me questions, but I broke\\naway and going up-stairs looked hastily through\\nthe unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me\\ndefinitely that his parents were dead.

He was\\nso hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform\\nbecause he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First\\ntime I saw him was when he come into Winebren-\\nner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for\\na job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days.\\n“Come on have some lunch with me,’ I sid. He ate\\nmore than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”\\n\\n206 THE GREAT GATSBY\\n“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.\\n“Start him! I made him.”\\ncc Oh.”’\\n“T raised him up out of nothing, right out of the\\ngutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing,\\ngentlemanly young man, and when he told me he\\nwas an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I\\ngot him to join up in the American Legion and he\\nused to stand high there. Right off he did some\\nwork for a client of mine up to Albany. We were\\nso thick like that in everything”—he held up two\\nbulbous fingers—‘‘always together.”\\nT wondered if this partnership had included the\\nWorld’s Series transaction in 1919.\\n“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. ‘‘ You\\nwere his closest friend, so I know you'll want to\\ncome to his funeral this afternoon.”\\n“T’d like to come.”\\n“Well, come then.”\\nThe hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as\\nhe shook his head his eyes filled with tears.\\n“T can’t doit—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he\\nsaid.\\n“‘There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over\\nnow.”\\n“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed\\nup in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a\\nyoung man it was different—if a friend of mine died,\\nno matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 207\\nmay think that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the\\nbitter end.”\\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was de-\\ntermined not to come, so I stood up.\\n“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.\\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest\\na “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and shook my\\nhand.\\n“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man\\nwhen he is alive and not after he is dead,” he sug-\\ngested. “After that my own rule is to let everything\\nalone.”\\nWhen I left his office the sky had turned dark and\\nI got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing\\nmy clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz\\nwalking up and down excitedly in the hall. His\\npride in his son and in his son’s possessions was con-\\ntinually increasing and now he had something to\\nshow me.\\n‘Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his\\nwallet with trembling fingers. “Look there.”\\nIt was a photograph of the house, cracked in the\\ncorners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out\\nevery detail to me eagerly. ‘Look there!” and then\\nsought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it\\nso often that I think it was more real to him now\\nthan the house itself.\\n‘Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty\\npicture. It shows up well.”\\n\\n208 THE GREAT GATSBY\\n“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”\\n‘He come out to see me two years ago and bought\\nme the house I live in now. Of course we was broke\\nup when he run off from home, but I see now there\\nwas a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in\\nfront of him. And ever since he made a success he\\nwas very generous with me.”\\nHe seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held\\nit for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes.\\nThen he returned the wallet and pulled from his\\npocket a ragged old copy of a book called “ Hop-\\nalong Cassidy.”\\n“‘Look here, this is a book he had when he was a\\nboy.

This foreshadows his later relentless pursuit of success and the idealized life he crafts.\\r\\n2. **Contrasting Worlds:** The juxtaposition of the humble book and the elaborate schedule emphasizes the transformation Gatsby undergoes. His youthful aspirations find expression in a structured plan, hinting at the meticulously curated persona he builds later.\\r\\n3. **Fatherly Pride & Memory:** Mr. Gatz's treasure in this faded book demonstrates how tangible reminders of Gatsby's past hold immense value for him. It reinforces the emotional connection and idealized image the father holds of his son.\\r\\n4. **\\\"No Wasting Time...\\\":**  The resolves reveal Gatsby's aversion to idleness even then, setting a tone for his future driven nature.

It represents the foundation upon which his ambitious self was built, adding layers to his complex character. \\r\\n\\r\\n**In Conclusion:** This seemingly simple book excerpt, when analyzed within the *Great Gatsby* context, offers profound insights into Gatsby's character arc, his disciplined nature, and the enduring impact of his past on his constructed future.\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

West\\nEgg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic\\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a\\nhundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque,\\ncrouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a\\nlustreless moon.

But\\nno one knows the woman’s name, and no one\\ncares.\\nAfter Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for\\nme like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of\\ncorrection.

When I had finished\\nshe told me without comment that she was en-\\ngaged to another man. I doubted that, though there\\nwere several she could have married at a nod of her\\nhead, but I pretended to be surprised.

Nick acknowledges her past influence on him.\\r\\n* **Tom Buchanan:** Aggressive, restless, involved in the Myrtle Wilson incident, reveals his actions to Nick under pressure.\\r\\n* **Myrtle Wilson (implied):**  Victim of the hit-and-run, Tom's affair with her was a key factor in the unfolding tragedy.  Wilson (her husband) is mentioned as seeking truth and driven to desperation.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Relationships & Dynamics:**\\r\\n* **Nick & Jordan:** Past romantic entanglement, now strained. Jordan's casual revelation of her engagement highlights the distance. Nick feels a mix of anger, lingering affection, and sadness.\\r\\n* **Nick & Tom:**  Antagonistic. Nick confronts Tom about his role in Myrtle's death, revealing their clashing perspectives and truths.\\r\\n* **Tom & Myrtle:**  Infidelity, a destructive secret affair at the heart of the tragedy. Tom's admission to Nick underscores the gravity of his involvement.\\r\\n* **Wilson & Myrtle:**  Husband and wife, deeply affected by the accident and Tom's deceit. Wilson's pursuit of truth points to tragic consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Setting & Atmosphere:**\\r\\n* **Shifting Locations:**  Emphasis on \\\"West Egg\\\" (grotesque yet alluring), Fifth Avenue (urban confrontation), highlighting contrasting settings reflecting the narrative's complexities.\\r\\n* **Distortion & Memory:** Nick's perception of the East, especially after Gatsby's death, is skewed and haunting. This reflects the impact of events and his attempts to grapple with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Themes (Emerging):**\\r\\n* **Truth and Deception:**  The narrative revolves around uncovering hidden truths and the consequences of lies (Tom's actions, Jordan's casual approach).\\r\\n* **Social Decay & Illusion:** The glamorous facade of the Roaring Twenties masks darker realities (affairs, reckless behavior, shattered lives).\\r\\n* **Personal Responsibility & Regret:** Nick's journey involves confronting his own role and the weight of choices made amidst societal turmoil. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Next Passage Expectations:**  The excerpt likely delves deeper into Tom's confession, revealing further details about the Myrtle Wilson incident and its impact on the characters involved.

I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided\\nhim when I got off the train.\\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because\\nthose gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with\\nme so vividly that I could still hear the music and\\n\\nTHE GREAT GATSBY 217\\nthe laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,\\nand the cars going up and down his drive. One\\nnight I did hear a material car there, and saw its\\nlights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investi-\\ngate. Probably it was some final guest who had\\nbeen away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know\\nthat the party was over.\\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my\\ncar sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at\\nthat huge incoherent failure of a house once more.\\nOn the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by\\nsome boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in\\nthe moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe\\nraspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down\\nto the beach and sprawled out on the sand.\\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and\\nthere were hardly any lights except the shadowy,\\nmoving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And\\nas the moon rose higher the inessential houses began\\nto melt away until gradually I became aware of\\nthe old island here that flowered once for Dutch\\nsailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world.\\nIts vanished trees, the trees that had made way for\\nGatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to\\nthe last and greatest of all human dreams; for a\\ntransitory enchanted moment man must have held\\nhis breath in the presence of this continent, com-\\npelled into an esthetic contemplation he neither un-\\nderstood nor desired, face to face for the last time\\n\\n218 THE GREAT GATSBY\\nin history with something commensurate to his\\ncapacity for wonder.\\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown\\nworld, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first\\npicked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock.\\nHe had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his\\ndream must have seemed so close that he could\\nhardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it\\nwas already behind him, somewhere back in that\\nvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark\\nfields of the republic rolled on under the night.\\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic\\nfuture that year by year recedes before us. It eluded\\nus then, but that’s no matter—to-morrow we will\\nrun faster, stretch out our arms farther. ... And\\none fine morning——\\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne\\nback ceaselessly into the past.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"## Entities and Relationships Extracted from  \\\"The Great Gatsby\\\" Passage:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Characters:**\\r\\n* **Narrator (Nick Carraway):** Central observer, reflecting on events and Gatsby's dream.\\r\\n* **Tom Buchanan:** Daisy's husband, careless, wealthy, embodies societal flaws.\\r\\n* **Daisy Buchanan:** Married to Tom, entangled in Gatsby's affections, represents elusive desire.\\r\\n* **Jay Gatsby:**  Central figure, driven by a yearning for the past and Daisy's love.\\r\\n* **Myrtle Wilson:** Killed by Gatsby (implied), victim of careless actions, symbolizes societal casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Locations & Symbols:**\\r\\n* **Gatsby's House:**  Symbol of Gatsby's ambition, ultimately an \\\"incoherent failure,\\\" mirroring his dream.\\r\\n* **Green Light (Daisy's Dock):** Gatsby's yearning, hope for the past, constantly receding ideal.\\r\\n* **East Egg/West Egg:**  Opulent communities representing different social spheres and Gatsby's outsider status.\\r\\n* **\\\"Old Island\\\" / Original Wilderness:** Represents a lost innocence and connection to nature, contrasted with modern excess.\\r\\n* **New York City:**  Setting of Gatsby's lavish parties, symbolizes glamour and fleeting pleasures.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Themes & Relationships (Deduced):**\\r\\n* **The American Dream & Illusion:** Gatsby's pursuit embodies a corrupted dream, built on wealth and recapture of the past, ultimately failing.\\r\\n* **Past vs. Present:**  Central conflict - clinging to an idealized past versus accepting the changing present.

      "return": "\"The Great Gatsby\" is set in 1920s America and revolves around the character Jay Gatsby. The story begins with Nick Carraw, who has moved back to West Egg after living in New York for some time. He then describes his first meetings with Daisy Buchanan, his love interest from high school days.\n\nGatsby’s quest is to win Daisy's hand, which he believes she abandoned him for when they broke off their relationship years ago. Gatsby has bought a mansion in the hopes of making her see that he has transformed into an idealized person. Throughout the book, Nick observes how Gatsby tries various ways to get closer to Daisy including inviting her to his parties and asking him directly if they can meet.\n\nThe narrative also delves into rumors about Gatsby’s past, suggesting he might have been involved in a fatal car accident that killed Myrtle Wilson, the mistress of Tom Buchanan (Daisy's husband). Furthermore, it exposes several characters’ inner lives, including Daisy's flirtatious nature with other men, and her own reservations towards Gatsby.\n\nThroughout the book, Nick acts as an observer, narrating various scenes. He also serves as a bridge connecting different events, often providing insights or revealing information about key moments that take place off-stage. The story culminates in a meeting between Gatsby and Daisy, where they express their feelings for each other but ultimately decide not to reunite due to the societal restrictions imposed by their class differences.\n\nThe novel ends with an introspective conversation among Nick, Jordan Baker, and Gatsby about Gatsby's hopes and aspirations. It hints at the moral decay of a social elite while also exploring themes such as love, ambition, and the futility of pursuing material success without genuine connection or meaning in one’s life.",

The pose might include him looking into the distance, symbolizing his longing for Daisy.\n\n2. **Modern Art Movement**: A modern art movement style could be applied to Gatsby's image. He may look like he is emerging from a painting, with elements of Cubism or Surrealism such as distorted facial features and an almost ghostly aura, representing his elusive nature and his dreams that often seemed far from reality.\n\n3. **Expressionist Art**: Expressionist art can be used to create Gatsby's image, showing him in a way that exaggerates his emotions—excitement, melancholy, or longing—representing the depth of his feelings for Daisy and his desire for her return.\n\n4. **Photorealistic Portrait**: A photorealistic portrait could depict Jay Gatsby as he might have appeared in real life. His attire, facial features, and posture can be carefully crafted to match a plausible historical look for someone from his era who is now wealthy and living an aristocratic lifestyle.\n\n5. **Minimalist Art**: You could use minimalist art techniques where Gatsby's image includes only essential elements—perhaps a simple suit or robe with a single accessory like a watch, emphasizing his refined tastes without unnecessary details.\n\nEach of these styles would provide different visual experiences that highlight different aspects of Jay Gatsby’s character and the story.",

Despite their past, Gatsby continues to be obsessed with her and throws extravagant parties that are said to attract people from all walks of life in the hopes of encountering her.\n\nThe story also follows Nick Carrawater, a young man who is invited to these parties and serves as an observer of Gatsby's obsession and his interactions with Daisy. Throughout the novel, various characters’ lives intersect with Gatsby’s, including Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband; Myrtle Wilson, Daisy's married lover; Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy's; and George Wilson, whose wife is Myrtle.\n\nThe narrative explores themes such as wealth and class, love and obsession, social mobility, and the American Dream. The novel critiques the excesses and superficiality of the Roaring Twenties while highlighting the moral decay that often accompanies material success. Ultimately, \"The Great Gatsby\" paints a vivid picture of the world at the time it was written and continues to resonate with readers for its commentary on human nature and the pursuit of happiness in an era marked by both promise and disillusionment.",
